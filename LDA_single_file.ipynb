For the reporting year 2020, the\\nBMW Group has combined its Annual Report and its\\nSustainability Report (formerly the Sustainable Value\\nReport) in a single document. It is therefore important\\nfor us to begin by briefly explaining the structure and\\nrationale behind the new approach so that you, as a\\nstakeholder in the company, can make the best possible\\nuse of the report. Above all, this means being able to\\nfind and categorise the information you are looking\\nfor both quickly and reliably. Integrated reporting is a\\ndynamic process for the BMW Group that works in both\\ndirections. For this reason, we are not only seeking a\\ndialogue based on assertions underpinned by content,\\nwe are equally convinced that it enables us to report in\\nthe most effective way.\\n\\nThis version of the Annual Report is a translation\\nfrom the German version. Only the original German\\nversion is binding.\\n\\nSYMBOLS AND OTHER INFORMATION\\n\\n...\\n\\nThe contents of these sections were subjected to\\na separate limited assurance engagement by the\\nindependent auditor. All other audited sections\\nof the report underwent a reasonable assurance\\naudit engagement by the independent auditor.\\n\\nThe following symbols help the reader to navigate\\nthrough the report:\\nReturn to previous page\\nGo to table of contents\\nContinued on next page\\nCross reference\\n\\nOBJECTIVE\\n\\nAs a premium manufacturer, the BMW Group aspires\\nto lead the way in terms of sustainability. It is therefore\\ntaking responsibility and placing this topic at the core\\nof its corporate strategy moving forward. This change\\nhas involved taking a major step, as the BMW Group is\\nincluding sustainability as a prime factor in its corporate\\ndecision-making processes. This integrated approach\\nobviates the need to pursue a separate sustainability\\nstrategy. Sustainability principles – such as the prudent\\nuse of resources – are increasingly playing a key role in\\nshaping the BMW Group’s corporate strategy and serving\\nas key parameters for an integrated and multidimensional approach.\\nAs it embraces this process, the BMW Group is building on a solid foundation, given that it has repeatedly\\nset itself ambitious sustainability targets and assumed a\\npioneering role in this area over decades. For example,\\nthe BMW Group was the first company in the automotive\\nsector to appoint an environmental protection officer\\nback in 1973. Under the umbrella of Efficient Dynamics,\\nthe BMW Group proceeded to innovate in the field of\\nelectrified drivetrains, while at the same time developing\\nhighly efficient combustion engines, and has systematically continued to take this dual approach ever since. With\\na trial fleet of around 600 fully electric MINI E vehicles\\nmade available to customers, the BMW Group demonstrated as long ago as 2009 that electric mobility can be a\\nsource of great driving pleasure as well as being suitable\\nfor everyday use. The all-electric BMW i3 followed in 2013,\\neffectively setting the benchmark for sustainable mobility\\ngoing forward. In 2020, the Group also achieved its carbon emissions targets for the new vehicle fleet, thanks\\nto the growing size of its fleet of electrified vehicles.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nAbout This Report\\n\\n5\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nThe BMW Group has long considered it both its obligation and its mission to take a pioneering role within the\\nautomotive industry.\\nThe logical consequence, starting with this report, is\\nto inform stakeholders about the BMW Group’s business\\nperformance in a single integrated report. The objective\\nis to provide a clear insight into the BMW Group as a\\nwhole with the aim of making its activities transparent,\\naccountable and measurable. At the same time, the intention is to make it as easy as possible for readers to\\nfamiliarise themselves with the contents of the report.\\nFor this reason, key information is deliberately repeated\\nat various points in the document, providing a general\\noverview for readers focusing on specific chapters and\\nsections who do not intend to read the entire report.\\nThis approach not only underlines the BMW Group’s\\ndetermination to spearhead the transformation towards\\nsustainability, but also its desire to shape the process and\\nreport on it in a transparent manner. This report combines the Sustainability Report and the Annual Report\\nin a single Integrated Report, based on the framework\\nof the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC).\\nIt replaces the two previously separate publications and\\nwill be published each year on the date of the Annual\\nConference. The BMW Group is keen to demonstrate\\nto shareholders, customers, employees and, last but not\\nleast, the general public how economic, ecological and\\nsocial issues can complement one another. In fact, they\\nare often mutually dependent and the pursuit of sustainability is the driving force of the Group. The report\\nalso includes descriptions of corporate strategy, future\\ndevelopment and internal management processes and\\nhow the BMW Group, as part of society, creates value in\\neconomic, ecological and social terms. Join the conversation with the BMW Group Dialogue.\\n\\nCONTENT AND STRUCTURE\\n\\nOn 9 March 2021, the Financial Statements of\\nBMW AG were authorised for issue by the Board of Management and the Group Financial Statements approved\\nfor publication.\\nSimilar to annual reports in previous years, the\\nnew BMW Group Report combines the management\\nreports of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft\\n(BMW AG) and the BMW Group in a Combined Management Report.\\nIn accordance with § 289 b and § 315 b of the German Commercial Code (HGB), BMW AG is required to\\nissue a non-financial statement (NFS) at both Company\\nand Group level. This statement is published jointly for\\nBMW AG and the BMW Group as a non-financial report\\nwithin the Combined Management Report. In order to\\nidentify this content more easily, an NFS index is included as an appendix that summarises the references for the\\nreader. As in previous years, the NFS has been reviewed.\\nContents that have been subjected to a limited assurance\\nstandard are marked with graphic symbols ... . All\\nother parts of the Management Report and the Group\\nFinancial Statements have been audited to a reasonable\\nassurance standard, unchanged from the previous year.\\nFurther information is provided in the Independent Auditor’s\\nReport and the\\nIndependent Practitioner’s Report .\\nThis report also contains information on the attainment of targets relating to the now completed sustainability strategy for the period from 2012 to 2020.\\n\\nThe BMW Group has published sustainable value\\nreports since 2001, initially every two years and annually\\nsince 2012. Prior to this period, the Group had a long\\ntradition of publishing environmental reports, in which\\nit reported transparently on the impact of its operations\\non the environment, including mitigating measures.\\nSince 2005, the BMW Group has applied Global\\nReporting Initiative (GRI) standards to report on sustainability matters. Since 2008, it has voluntarily complied\\nwith the highest GRI application level (“comprehensive\\noption”). Additional GRI-relevant information is provided in the chapter Further GRI Information and in the GRI\\nContent Index. This information was also subjected to a\\nlimited assurance review.\\nIn 2015, the General Assembly of the United Nations\\n(UN) announced 17 Sustainable Development Goals\\n(SDGs). The SDGs are at the core of the 2030 Agenda, a\\nglobal action plan aiming to ensure that economic progress is environmentally friendly and socially equitable.\\nThe BMW Group has identified the SDGs to which it\\ncan make a direct and thus the greatest possible contribution with its own sustainability goals. Reference is\\nmade to these SDGs at the beginning of the Combined\\nManagement Report.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nAbout This Report\\n\\n6\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nThe report is structured to ensure that essential content is easily accessible, even at a glance. With this point\\nin mind, the key information is presented in summarised\\nform at the beginning of each section of the Management\\nReport and subsequently discussed in detail. In addition,\\ninformation provided in graphical form has been highlighted to enable key facts to be identified more easily.\\nConnection to Figures in the Group Financial\\nStatements\\nFor each topic, an assessment was carried out to identify figures\\nreported in the financial statements that enable a better understanding of the NFS, and which therefore require to be explained.\\nWhere necessary, these figures have been disclosed and explained in the relevant chapters.\\n\\nCURRENT AND FUTURE REPORTING\\n\\nIn light of the announcement that the major standards institutions (GRI, SASB, CDSB, CDP / TCFD and\\nIIRC) intend to collaborate, alongside regulatory developments relating to non-financial reporting (including\\nthe revision of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive),\\nthe reporting environment is likely to continue gaining\\nmomentum. At the same time, the BMW Group sees the\\ndevelopment of business strategy as an ongoing task, in\\norder to remain flexible within an increasingly dynamic\\nenvironment. Both aspects will play a key role in future\\nreporting. For this reason, the BMW Group plans to\\nreview its non-financial performance indicators in 2021.\\n\\nThe figures for fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and power consumption are calculated based on the measurement methods\\nstipulated in the current version of Regulation (EU) 715 / 2007.\\nThis information is based on a vehicle with basic equipment in\\nGermany': None, ' ranges take into account differences in wheel and\\ntyre size selected as well as optional equipment and can change\\nbased on configuration. Fuel Consumption and CO 2 Emissions\\nInformation are available in chapter Other Information.\\nThe figures have been calculated based on the new WLTP test cycle and adapted to NEDC for comparison purposes. In these vehicles, different figures than those published here may apply for the\\nassessment of taxes and other vehicle-related duties which are\\n(also) based on CO2 emissions.\\nFor further details of the official fuel consumption figures and\\nofficial specific CO2 emissions of new cars, please refer to the\\n“Manual on fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and power consumption of new cars”, available at www.dat.de/co2/ .\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nTo Our Stakeholders\\n\\n7\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nTO OUR\\nSTAKEHOLDERS\\n8\\n\\nBMW Group in Figures\\n\\n13\\n\\nReport of the Supervisory Board\\n\\n23\\n\\nStatement of the Chairman of the\\nBoard of Management\\n\\n29\\n\\nDialogue with Stakeholders\\n\\n33\\n\\nBMW Stock and Capital Markets in 2020\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nTo Our Stakeholders\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nBMW Group in Figures\\n\\n8\\n\\nBMW GROUP\\nIN FIGURES\\nKEY NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\n2018\\n\\n2019\\n\\n2020\\n\\nChange in %\\n\\n124,729\\n\\n129,932\\n\\n134,682\\n\\n126,016\\n\\n120,726\\n\\n– 4.2\\n\\n15.3\\n\\n16.0\\n\\n17.2\\n\\n17.2\\n\\n17.8\\n\\n3.5\\n\\n2,349,962\\n\\n2,465,021\\n\\n2,486,149\\n\\n2,537,504\\n\\n2,325,179\\n\\n– 8.4\\n\\n2.6\\n\\n4.2\\n\\n5.7\\n\\n5.8\\n\\n8.3\\n\\nGROUP\\nWorkforce at year-end 1\\nShare of women in management positions in the BMW Group\\n\\n2\\n\\nAUTOMOTIVE SEGMENT\\nDeliveries 3, 4\\nShare of electrified vehicles in deliveries\\nCO2 emissions EU New Vehicle Fleet (in g CO2 / km)\\nCO2 emissions per vehicle produced (in tons) 6\\n\\n5\\n\\n43.1\\n\\n124\\n\\n128\\n\\n128\\n\\n127\\n\\n99\\n\\n0.54\\n\\n0.41\\n\\n0.40\\n\\n0.30\\n\\n0.23\\n\\n– 23.3\\n\\n145,032\\n\\n164,153\\n\\n165,566\\n\\n175,162\\n\\n169,272\\n\\n– 3.4\\n\\n7\\n\\n– 22.0\\n\\nMOTORCYCLES SEGMENT\\nDeliveries\\n1\\n\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\nSince the reporting year 2020, a new definition for workforce size has been applied (see\\nGlossary).

The year unfolded very differently from the way\\nwe had anticipated at the end of 2019. Nevertheless, despite the challenging conditions,\\nthe BMW Group remained focused on its targets and pressed ahead with its future-oriented projects. Thanks to resolute crisis management and rigorous digital teamwork at\\nall levels, the BMW Group achieved a respectable result for the year, with deliveries to\\ncustomers in the fourth quarter at their highest level to date. This excellent collective\\nperformance gives us confidence as we go into 2021. Sustainable, digitalised mobility,\\ncombined with an outstanding overall customer experience, are the key supporting\\npillars of the BMW Group’s corporate strategy. As a pioneer of new technologies and\\nchampion of sustainability in economic, social and ecological terms, the BMW Group\\nwill continue on its transformational journey to becoming a tech company, thereby\\nstrengthening its position in the premium segment in the process.\\nFocus of Supervisory Board activities during the past financial year\\nThe Supervisory Board performed the duties incumbent upon it with the utmost\\ndiligence in 2020, rigorously monitoring the management of the BMW Group in a\\nconscientious manner. It also advised the Board of Management on matters relating\\nto the leadership and strategic evolution of the company. In five meetings of the full\\nSupervisory Board – all lasting significantly longer than usual due to the circumstances\\nand including one two-day meeting – together with the Board of Management we\\ndeliberated in great detail on the operating performance of the BMW Group. The\\nBoard of Management also kept the Supervisory Board informed of any matters of\\nsignificance outside the framework of formal meetings as the need arose. In addition,\\nthe Chairmen of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management engaged in\\ndirect dialogue on current issues, as did the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the\\nBoard of Management member responsible for Finance. Conference calls were also held\\nbetween the Members of the Board of Management, the Board of Management member\\nresponsible for Finance, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the Chairman of\\nthe Audit Committee as a supplementary measure.\\nThe Board of Management’s regular reports on the Group’s current performance\\nwere dominated by pandemic-related matters during the year under report. In view\\nof the rapid spread of coronavirus in the spring, additional meetings of the Audit\\n\\nThe SUPERVISORY BOARD\\nis convinced that the\\nBMW Group will continue to\\nexpand its position in the\\npremium segment through its\\nenduring commitment to\\nsustainability in economic,\\nsocial and ecological terms.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nTo Our Stakeholders\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport of the Supervisory Board\\n\\nCommittee and the Presiding Board were scheduled to facilitate the monitoring of\\nproduction, sales and liquidity developments in a prompt manner. The Board of Management kept us constantly informed regarding the impact of the pandemic on the\\nBMW Group’s business performance, providing up-to-date status reports on sales, production, liquidity and the Financial Services segment. Information on vehicle deliveries\\nto customers was separately analysed by market and model, focusing particularly on the\\nelectrified variants. The reports also dealt with the competitive situation in general and\\nthe development of new business and transaction volume as well as the risk situation in\\nthe Financial Services segment. The Board of Management pointed out deviations from\\nthe original forecast and presented measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. It\\nalso outlined potential developments based on a range of possible scenarios. The size\\nof the workforce and the attainment of the decarbonisation targets set out by the EU\\nCommission were also a subject of discussion.\\nFurthermore, the Board of Management provided us with information on a number\\nof important current topics, including the opening of the Competence Centre for electric\\ndrivetrain production in Dingolfing and BMW Brilliance Automotive’s second battery\\ncentre in China as well as the new communication concept for the futuristic technology\\nshowcase #NEXT Gen 2020, which was held virtually for the first time. The reports also\\naddressed the topics of product quality and the progress of the HERE joint venture.\\nThe Supervisory Board deliberated in depth on the BMW Group’s evolving corporate\\nstrategy, which is now clearly focused on the progressive transformation of its drivetrain\\ntechnology towards electric mobility. The Board of Management outlined to us the\\nrenewed production network strategy, which is based on converting the Munich plant\\nto assemble the new vehicle architecture and the planned cluster architecture at the\\nBMW Group plant in Hungary. As a core component of the BMW Group’s overarching\\ncorporate strategy, we also took an in-depth look at the sustainability aspect, which is\\nembedded at every stage along the supply chain, the production process and the entire\\nlife cycle of our products.\\nThe Supervisory Board also deliberated at length on important issues arising within\\nthe Board of Management’s various key areas of responsibility. Purchasing, for instance,\\nreported on the status of the supply chain and the purchasing strategy regarding raw\\nmaterials for electric mobility. The Board of Management member responsible for Finance gave a talk on the Group’s financing system, focusing in particular on liquidity\\nmanagement and financial market risk management. When reporting on the Financial\\n\\n15\\n\\nServices segment, the main focus was on strategy as well as business performance and\\nthe risk situation. We also analysed the BMW Group’s strategic cooperations in great\\ndetail, particularly the further course of the “Your Now” joint venture strategy and the\\nmarket situation in China.\\nIn light of the coronavirus pandemic and the accompanying restrictions on events\\ninvolving large numbers of people, in early April we agreed that the 2020 Annual\\nGeneral Meeting should be held as a virtual event without the physical presence of\\nshareholders.\\nAn important topic for the Supervisory Board in 2020 was the revision of the Board\\nof Management’s remuneration system for the financial years 2021 and beyond, in line\\nwith the new version of the German Corporate Governance Code. After the Personnel\\nCommittee had completed the initial groundwork, in the third quarter we intensively\\ndiscussed proposals for a new remuneration concept with the help of an independent\\nremuneration consultant. On this basis, in December we worked through the details\\nof the revised remuneration system, focusing in particular on setting targets for the\\nvariable remuneration components. The Supervisory Board finally passed a resolution\\napproving the new remuneration system, including a standardised service agreement,\\nnew target remuneration levels and total remuneration caps.\\nThe Supervisory Board reviewed the structure and level of Board of Management remuneration for the financial year 2020, whilst also taking into account the BMW Group’s\\nbusiness performance in 2020. The salaries of senior executives and employees within\\nGermany as a whole were also taken into account. After analysing comparative studies\\nprovided by an external remuneration consultant, we concluded that the remuneration\\nof Board of Management members is appropriate. Detailed information on the remuneration of the Board of Management is provided in the Remuneration Report.\\nThe change to the system of Board of Management remuneration was also the focus\\nof one-on-one discussions between myself and investor representatives concerning\\nSupervisory-Board-related issues, including the question of the independence of Supervisory Board members.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nTo Our Stakeholders\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport of the Supervisory Board\\n\\nIn the third quarter, the Supervisory Board devoted a great deal of time to examining the BMW Group’s revised forecast for the period from 2021 to 2026. The Board\\nof Management outlined the fundamental changes made to mitigate the impact of\\nthe coronavirus pandemic compared with the forecast presented one year earlier as\\nwell as the ambitious long-term targets in the forecast. It also pointed out the higher\\ndegree of volatility and uncertainty in terms of external framework conditions, whilst\\nreiterating the aim of achieving continuous overall growth, particularly in the field of\\nelectric mobility. After thorough examination, the Supervisory Board approved the\\nBMW Group’s long-term corporate plan.\\nAt the final meeting held in 2020, the Board of Management presented the annual\\nbudget for corporate development in the financial year 2021 and discussed it in exhaustive detail with the Supervisory Board.\\nWith the advance of digitalisation, data protection and cybersecurity are becoming\\nincreasingly important issues. For this reason, we requested a report on the current\\nstatus from the Board of Management.\\nWe also discussed the topic of diversity at considerable length. The Board of Management reported on the current status of the diversity concepts developed by the\\nGroup and the target achievement at various levels as well as future targets. As its\\ntarget for the proportion of women on the Board of Management from 1 January 2021 to\\n31 December 2025, the Supervisory Board has stipulated that the Board of Management\\nshould continue to include at least one female member.\\nThe Supervisory Board’s agenda also included a number of internal issues during\\nthe year under report. For example, the Supervisory Board updated its rules of procedure and published them online in accordance with the recommendation of the\\nrevised German Corporate Governance Code. At the Supervisory Board meeting held\\nin March, we also discussed the results of our annual efficiency self-assessment in\\ndetail. The Supervisory Board has also benefited from advances in digitalisation, a key\\nelement of our corporate strategy, by setting up a digital boardroom to improve the flow\\nof information. Due to coronavirus-related restrictions, beginning in the spring, the\\nmeetings themselves were held as face-to-face events with digital participation offered\\nto enable all members to attend.\\n\\n16\\n\\nThe main focus of\\n\\nSUPERVISORY BOARD\\nWORK was on the continued\\ndevelopment of corporate\\nstrategy, particularly the\\nexpansion of electric mobility.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nTo Our Stakeholders\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport of the Supervisory Board\\n\\n17\\n\\nWe also discussed corporate governance standards at the BMW Group. Based\\non a self-assessment, we concluded that the composition of the Supervisory Board\\nat 31 December 2020 was in line with the targets stipulated in the diversity concept,\\nthe competency profile and other composition targets. We updated the competency\\nprofile and broadened the definition of the various areas of expertise. An overview\\nshowing each individual Supervisory Board member’s areas of expertise is provided in\\nthe Statement of Corporate Governance on our website.\\nIn December, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board issued their\\nDeclaration of Compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code. We will\\ncomply with the recommendations of the Code as amended on 16 December 2019\\nwithout exception. The wording of the Declaration of Compliance can be found in the\\nStatement of Corporate Governance on our website.\\nThe Supervisory Board took part in a variety of further training measures in 2020.\\nIn July, for instance, we visited the BMW Autonomous Driving Campus in Unterschleißheim near Munich and discussed the topic of automated driving at great length\\nthrough several presentations. The presentation held by an external expert on artificial\\nintelligence gave us additional food for thought on the importance of software for\\nthe future of the automotive industry, which we then explored in greater depth in a\\nsubsequent discussion. In September, the Supervisory Board attended a workshop on\\ndrivetrain technology at the BMW and MINI Driving Academy in Maisach near Munich,\\nincluding a driving session.\\nNo conflicts of interest arose on the part of members of the Supervisory Board\\nduring the year under report. Significant transactions involving Supervisory Board\\nmembers and / or other related parties as defined by IAS 24, including close relatives\\nand intermediary entities, were subject to review on a quarterly basis.\\nWe reviewed the efficiency of our work in the Supervisory Board by completing\\na revised and expanded questionnaire as well as holding supplementary discussions\\nwith the Chairman. Overall, there is a high degree of satisfaction with the work of\\nthe Supervisory Board. Cooperation, both within the Supervisory Board itself and\\nwith the Board of Management, was unanimously assessed as being constructive and\\ntrusting. However, we intend to discuss suggestions for improving individual aspects\\nof cooperation in the new financial year.\\n\\nSustainability is at the heart\\nof the BMW Group’s broader\\nstrategy, encompassing\\nall relevant aspects, from the\\nsupply chain to production\\nand the product life cycle.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nTo Our Stakeholders\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport of the Supervisory Board\\n\\nDescription of Presiding Board activities and committee work\\nThe Supervisory Board has established a Presiding Board and four committees. The\\nchairpersons of these two bodies reported in detail on the work of their committees\\nat each subsequent Supervisory Board meeting. You can read more about the duties,\\nthe composition and the working methods of the Presiding Board and various other\\nSupervisory Board committees in the Statement of Corporate Governance on our website.\\nDue to the exceptional challenges of the past financial year caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the Presiding Board and the Audit Committee intensified their work\\nin order to fulfil their duties in a suitable manner. Additional meetings were held to\\nprovide the Presiding Board with prompt information on the current status of sales and\\nproduction and the Audit Committee with information on liquidity and the Financial\\nServices business.\\nThe Presiding Board held six meetings and one conference call during the financial\\nyear 2020. Together with the Board of Management and senior heads of department, we\\nprepared the detailed agenda of full Supervisory Board meetings (unless a committee\\nwas responsible for doing so) and made suggestions for topics to be reported on at\\nSupervisory Board meetings.\\nThe Audit Committee held seven meetings and three conference calls during the\\nyear under report.\\nThe meetings held in February and March 2020 focused primarily on preparing\\nthe Supervisory Board meeting at which the financial statements for the financial year\\n2019 were to be discussed and examined. After obtaining the auditor’s Declaration of\\nIndependence, the Audit Committee recommended to the full Supervisory Board that\\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (“PwC”) be proposed\\nfor election as auditor at the 2020 Annual General Meeting. There were no indications\\nof conflicts of interest, grounds for exclusion or lack of independence on the part of\\nthe auditor.\\nThe Audit Committee discussed PwC’s fee proposal for audits of the year-end Company and Group Financial Statements 2020 and the review of the Half-Year Financial\\nReport and deemed it appropriate. Following approval by the Annual General Meeting\\nheld in May 2020, the Audit Committee appointed PwC for the relevant engagements\\nand specified audit focus areas. It also approved the scope of non-audit services to be\\n\\n18\\n\\nprovided by PwC and subsequently received regular reports on the relevant matters.\\nThe quality of the audit was a subject of discussion at the Supervisory Board meetings\\nheld in February and June. The Board concluded that the audit was of good quality.\\nThe Board of Management presented us with the Sustainable Value Report as well\\nas the separate combined non-financial report of BMW AG and the BMW Group for\\nthe financial year 2019. Moreover, the representatives of PwC presented the findings\\nof their review, which had been performed as a “limited assurance” engagement.\\nAt our meetings we also discussed preparations for the new Integrated Group Report\\nand the procedural changes required with regard to reporting and the external audit.\\nWe decided that the non-financial (Group) statement should again be reviewed by PwC\\nin the form of a “limited assurance” engagement.\\nWe also discussed the quarterly statement with the Board of Management prior\\nto their publication. Representatives of the external auditors were present when the\\nHalf-Year Financial Report was discussed at the beginning of August 2020.\\nThe Audit Committee again dealt intensively with the topic of compliance within the\\nBMW Group during the year under report. In his regular report, the Chairman of the\\nCompliance Committee provided a summary of ongoing compliance-related proceedings\\nand presented a raft of measures aimed at promoting the continuous improvement of\\nthe compliance system. The Head of Corporate Quality also reported on the subject of\\ntechnical compliance. The relevant head of department also presented the Supervisory\\nBoard a description of tax and customs compliance management.\\nFurthermore, the Audit Committee regularly discussed the status of the EU Commission’s investigation into the antitrust allegations connected with the former working\\ngroups of several German automobile manufacturers and was provided with updates\\nfrom the Board of Management regarding the potential further course of proceedings.\\nIn relation to proceedings initiated by the German Federal Cartel Office and terminated in 2019 with a fine of € 28 million regarding the purchase of long steel by the\\nBMW Group, the Supervisory Board addressed the question of whether it had a duty\\nto act on this matter. The Supervisory Board sought counsel from external lawyers in\\norder to obtain legal certainty. On the recommendation of the Audit Committee and\\nafter carefully considering the advantages and disadvantages for the BMW Group, based\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nTo Our Stakeholders\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport of the Supervisory Board\\n\\non an expert legal opinion and oral explanations, the Supervisory Board decided not\\nto assert any claims for damages against current or former members of the Board of\\nManagement of BMW AG in connection with the fine imposed by the German Federal\\nCartel Office on 21 November 2019.\\nIn addition, the main findings of internal audits conducted by Corporate Audit as\\nwell as details of advance audit planning were reported to the Audit Committee. We\\ndiscussed the effectiveness of the BMW Group’s current risk profile and risk management system on several occasions, including ongoing measures to improve the internal\\ncontrol system on a continuous basis.\\nThe Audit Committee was regularly provided with detailed information regarding\\nmajor legal disputes and proceedings. These included, in particular, an investigation\\ninitiated in December 2019 by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into\\npossible violations of US securities laws in relation to the reporting of vehicle delivery\\nfigures in the USA. The case was concluded in September 2020 with a settlement of\\n18 million US dollars.\\nOur agenda also included considering an audit report relating to the European\\nMarket Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). In this context, the independent auditor\\nconfirmed the effectiveness of the system currently applied by BMW AG to ensure\\ncompliance with the regulatory requirements.\\nThe Audit Committee concurred with the decision of the Board of Management\\nto raise the Company’s share capital in accordance with Article 4 (5) of the Articles of\\nIncorporation (Authorised Capital 2019) by € 822,000 and issue a corresponding number\\nof new non-voting bearer shares of preferred stock in conjunction with the Employee\\nShare Programme.\\n\\n19\\n\\nThe SUPERVISORY BOARD\\nand the BOARD\\n\\nOF\\nMANAGEMENT will comply\\nwith the recommendations\\nof the German Corporate\\nGovernance Code without\\nexception.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nTo Our Stakeholders\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport of the Supervisory Board\\n\\nThe Personnel Committee focused primarily on the topic of Board of Management\\nremuneration. In its five meetings during the year under report, the Personnel Committee reviewed the appropriateness of the Board of Management’s remuneration for the\\nfinancial year 2019, duly taking the impact of the coronavirus pandemic into account.\\nDuring the second half of the year, the Committee focused on revising the remuneration\\nsystem for Board of Management members. The Personnel Committee also performed\\nthe groundwork for the full Supervisory Board to appoint a Board of Management\\nmember responsible for Development and granted approval for members of the Board\\nof Management to assume mandates outside the Group in exceptional cases.\\nThe Nomination Committee convened twice during the financial year 2020. Taking\\ninto account the German Corporate Governance Code (DGCC) and the composition\\nrequirements adopted by the Supervisory Board, the Nomination Committee addressed\\nthe issue of potential replacements for shareholder representatives on the Supervisory\\nBoard in the coming years.\\nThe Mediation Committee, which is prescribed by law, did not need to convene\\nduring the financial year 2020.\\nComposition of the Board of Management\\nWith effect from 1 July 2020, Klaus Fröhlich retired from his position as Board of\\nManagement member responsible for Development. We would like to thank Mr Fröhlich\\nfor his many years of successful and effective work for BMW AG and particularly wish\\nto express our appreciation for the momentum he generated over a 30-year period in\\nadvancing the BMW Group’s role as a pioneer of new technologies.\\nThe Supervisory Board appointed Frank Weber to the Board of Management as his\\nsuccessor with effect from 1 July 2020. Mr Weber joined the BMW Group in 2011 as\\nHead of Total Vehicle Development and was most recently responsible for the RollsRoyce product line as well as the BMW luxury class. In light of the various management\\npositions he has previously held in development, Mr Weber is excellently qualified to\\nassume responsibility for Development at the BMW Group and we certainly wish him\\nall the best in his new role.\\nThe Supervisory Board extended the mandate of one Board of Management member\\nduring the year under report.\\n\\n20\\n\\nComposition of the Supervisory Board, the Presiding Board and the Supervisory Board’s\\ncommittees\\nProf. Renate Köcher left the Supervisory Board with effect from the end of the\\nAnnual General Meeting 2020. We would like to thank Prof. Köcher for her many\\nyears of constructive work and faithful cooperation while serving on the Supervisory\\nBoard. The Annual General Meeting elected Anke Schäferkordt as a new member of\\nthe Supervisory Board. Ms Schäferkordt has a wealth of knowledge and experience in\\nthe field of communication and media, and, in her capacity as an independent financial\\nexpert, ideally complements the Supervisory Board’s overall composition. The Annual\\nGeneral Meeting re-elected me as a member of the Supervisory Board and I was again\\nelected Chairman at the subsequent meeting of the Supervisory Board.\\nIn view of the considerable length of time he has been a member of the Supervisory Board and mindful of the Supervisory Board’s efforts to appoint an independent\\nchairperson to the Audit Committee as defined in the German Corporate Governance\\nCode, Dr Karl-Ludwig Kley resigned his membership and chairmanship of the Audit\\nCommittee with effect from the end of the 2020 Annual General Meeting. We wish to\\nthank Dr Kley for his many years of knowledgeable and committed leadership of the\\nAudit Committee and are delighted that he will continue to contribute his expertise as\\na member of the Supervisory Board. Dr Kurt Bock was subsequently elected as member\\nand Chairman of the Audit Committee.

PwC conducted a review of the\\ncondensed Interim Group Financial Statements and the Interim Group Management\\nReport for the six-month period ended 30 June 2020 and presented its findings to the\\nAudit Committee. No issues were identified that might indicate that the condensed\\nInterim Group Financial Statements and Interim Group Management Report had not\\nbeen prepared in accordance with the applicable provisions in all material respects.\\nPwC, for the second time, audited the Company and Group Financial Statements\\nfor the financial year 2020 as well as the Combined Management Report, including\\nthe Statement on Corporate Governance for the financial year 2020 – in each case\\nauthorised for issue by the Board of Management on 9 March 2021 – and issued an\\nunqualified audit opinion, signed for the second year in succession by the auditor\\nPetra Justenhoven as independent auditor (Wirtschaftsprüferin) and by Andreas Fell as\\nindependent auditor (Wirtschaftsprüfer) and auditor responsible for the performance\\nof the engagement.\\nAt its meeting held on 26 February 2021, the Audit Committee initially considered\\nin detail the preliminary version of the Company and Group Financial Statements,\\nthe Combined Management Report (including the Combined Non-financial (Group)\\nStatement), the Statement of Corporate Governance, the draft versions of the auditor’s\\nreports and the Board of Management’s proposal for the appropriation of profit.\\nImmediately after authorising their issue, the Board of Management submitted the\\nCompany and Group Financial Statements for the financial year 2020 and the Combined\\nManagement Report (including the Combined Non-financial (Group) Statement), the\\nStatement of Corporate Governance and the proposal for the appropriation of profit to\\nthe Supervisory Board. The auditor’s long-form audit reports were also made available\\nto the Supervisory Board in a prompt manner.\\nAt its meeting on 10 March 2021, the Audit Committee diligently examined and\\ndeliberated on these documents before they were considered in detail at the plenary\\nsession of the Supervisory Board on 11 March 2021.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nTo Our Stakeholders\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport of the Supervisory Board\\n\\nAt the two respective meetings, the Board of Management provided the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board with detailed explanations of the financial reports\\npresented. The representatives of the external auditor present at the meetings reported\\non the main findings of their audit and answered additional questions put by members\\nof the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board. The focus of these meetings was\\non key audit matters as well as the related audit procedures, which were discussed at\\nlength by the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board.\\nThe representatives of the external auditor confirmed that the risk management\\nsystem established by the Board of Management is capable of identifying at an early\\nstage any developments that might threaten the Company’s going concern status. They\\nalso confirmed that no material weaknesses in the internal control system and risk\\nmanagement system were identified with regard to the financial reporting process. Similarly, in the course of their audit work they did not identify any facts inconsistent with\\nthe contents of the Declaration of Compliance pursuant to § 161 of the German Stock\\nCorporation Act (AktG) issued by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.\\nBased on a thorough examination conducted by the Audit Committee and the full\\nSupervisory Board, we concurred with the results of the external audit. In accordance\\nwith the conclusion reached by the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board after\\nthe examination, no objections were raised. The Group and Company Financial Statements of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft for the financial year 2020\\ndrawn by the Board of Management were subsequently approved at our meeting held\\non 11 March 2021. The Company Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2020 have therefore been adopted.\\nWe also examined the proposal of the Board of Management to use the unappropriated profit to pay a dividend of € 1.90 per share of common stock and € 1.92 per share\\nof non-voting preferred stock, in each case on shares entitled to receive a dividend. We\\nconsidered the proposal appropriate and therefore gave it our approval.\\nThe Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board also considered at length the\\ncombined Non-financial (Group) Statement for the year ended 31 December 2020,\\nwhich was drawn up by the Board of Management for the first time as part of the\\nIntegrated Group Report. The Board of Management provided an in-depth explanation of the statement during the relevant meetings. Representatives of the external\\nauditor presented key findings of their audit and answered additional questions posed\\n\\n22\\n\\nby the members of the Supervisory Board. The “limited assurance” audit performed\\nby PwC received an unqualified opinion, which was duly signed by Andreas Fell as\\nindependent auditor (Wirtschaftsprüfer) and by Nicolette Behncke as independent\\nauditor (Wirtschaftsprüferin). The Supervisory Board acknowledged and approved the\\ncombined Non-financial (Group) Statement drawn up by the Board of Management.\\nExpression of appreciation by the Supervisory Board\\nWe would like to express our special thanks to the members of the Board of Management and the entire workforce of the BMW Group worldwide for their remarkable\\nachievements in the financial year 2020. Their outstanding degree of motivation, adaptability and strong team spirit made this result possible, despite the extremely difficult\\nconditions.\\nWe are confident that the Board of Management and the employees of the\\nBMW Group, with their courage and willingness to adapt, will ensure your company\\na leading position in the field of sustainable and digitalised mobility going forward.\\n\\nMunich, March 2021\\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board\\n\\nNORBERT REITHOFER\\nChairman of the Supervisory Board\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nTo Our Stakeholders\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nStatement of the Chairman of the Board of Management\\n\\n23\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF THE\\nCHAIRMAN OF THE\\nBOARD OF MANAGEMENT\\nThis year we are launching\\nour TECHNOLOGY\\n\\nOFFENSIVE with the NEW\\nALL-ELECTRIC\\nBMW models iX and i4.\\n\\nOliver Zipse\\nChairman of the Board of Management\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nTo Our Stakeholders\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nStatement of the Chairman of the Board of Management\\n\\n24\\n\\nDEAR SHAREHOLDERS,\\n\\nClimate change demands responses. Rethinking our mobility as a task for society\\nas a whole is one way of responding – with considerable impact and an important signalling effect. The BMW Group is a global, digitalised high-tech company for premium\\nmobility. With this idea of ourselves, we are driving and shaping the transformation of\\nour industry. To do so, we are relying on technological innovation in all relevant fields –\\nsustainable drivetrains, autonomous driving and intelligent integration of hardware and\\nsoftware, as well as for the digitalised automotive production of the future, up to and\\nincluding blockchain technology and artificial intelligence.\\nSuch profound upheavals like the sustainable mobility that we are combining step\\nby step with the principles of a circular economy require cooperation on a much larger\\nscale. The BMW Group is involved as a partner and visionary through cross-industry\\ntechnology alliances and platforms. We firmly believe that technological innovation,\\nin combination with responsible action, contributes to progress for companies and\\nthe economy, as well as benefiting the environment. We all share the same goal of a\\nclimate-neutral society.\\nFirst integrated BMW Group Report.\\nWe are documenting our impact on the road to climate neutrality. With the transition\\nto integrated reporting, we are documenting how we are managing the BMW Group\\nsystematically and in an integrated manner according to financial and sustainability\\ntargets. For you, dear shareholders, as well as for other stakeholders in this company,\\nwe want to verifiably show our progress. With this move, we are not just leading the\\nway among our key competitors. The BMW Group has followed a broad stakeholder\\napproach for years. We aim to set an example and are therefore comprehensively and\\nsystematically reducing our environmental footprint. Our aim is to achieve full transparency. We will naturally only be releasing the new Report online.\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\nPROGRESS through\\nTECHNOLOGY – that is what\\nthe BMW Group stands for.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nTo Our Stakeholders\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nStatement of the Chairman of the Board of Management\\n\\nRobust and flexible, adaptable and innovative – your company during\\nthe Covid-19 pandemic.\\nThe rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 around the globe struck while the BMW Group\\nwas in the midst of its multidimensional transformation. In hindsight, one thing is clear:\\nin a difficult environment with unforeseeable developments, your company proved just\\nhow robust, flexible, adaptable and innovative it is. Our greatest strength was taking a\\nrealistic view of things, relying more than ever before on the flexibility of our people.\\nThanks to this, we were able to meet our adjusted targets, which we announced early in\\nthe pandemic. At the same time, the Board of Management made far-reaching decisions\\nand significantly stepped up the pace of transformation at the BMW Group.\\nGlobal market share increased during the pandemic.\\nOur vehicles have given many people a sense of security during the pandemic. In\\nfact, cars were more popular than ever. Our customers bought over 2.3 million BMW,\\nMINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles – a decrease of only 8.4 percent from our record-breaking\\n2019. Nonetheless, the BMW Group was able to increase its global market share in\\n2020. Additionally, BMW Motorrad posted the second-best sales figures in its history\\nand BMW M GmbH had its most successful year ever.\\nEU CO₂ limits for 2020 significantly overfulfilled.\\nDespite the coronavirus pandemic, we delivered about a third more electrified BMW\\nand MINI vehicles to customers than the previous year. Our plug-in hybrids were highly\\nsought-after, as were our new fully electric models, the BMW iX3 * and MINI Cooper SE *.\\nBecause we started our preparations early, we were able to significantly overfulfil our\\nassigned CO₂ limit by about 5 g / km. This was never in any doubt for us. Our EU fleet\\nemissions are currently at 99 g / km and we will also meet the 2021 requirements.\\nAccepting things as they are and making the best of them.\\nDuring lockdown, we had to shut down production across our global network for\\nthe first time in BMW history. Shortly afterwards, we ramped up again – in a phased, yet\\nextremely timely manner. This enabled us to respond to different rates of development\\nin the markets quite precisely.\\n\\n* See\\n\\nFuel Consumption and CO2 Emissions Information.\\n\\n25\\n\\nListen to what CEO\\n\\nOLIVER ZIPSE has\\nto report about\\nthe financial year 2020.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nTo Our Stakeholders\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nStatement of the Chairman of the Board of Management\\n\\nOur associates implemented the new requirements with commitment and discipline –\\nand continue to do so. Every single vehicle launch went ahead as planned. Our supply\\nchain stayed up and running at all times and mastered the stress test of the coronavirus\\nyear. We kept in touch with our customers – personally and digitally. Thanks to our\\nnew Mobile Sales Office, we are also offering contactless consultation and sales in more\\nthan 60 markets.\\nThank you to all our customers': None, \" praise for our 120,726 associates.\\nPersonally, and on behalf of the Board of Management team, I would like to thank\\nall our customers for placing their trust in us. I would also explicitly like to thank our\\nretail organisation and suppliers and extend an especially warm thank you to all our\\nassociates. 2020 was an extremely challenging year, full of emotion, hope and setbacks,\\nbut the BMW team spirit prevailed. The Company and employee representatives found\\nsolutions together – just as Herbert Quandt would have wanted.\\nPhase I of our transformation – the e-mobility pioneer.\\nAt major tipping points, BMW has often ushered in change with bold decisions.\\nDuring the global economic and financial crisis of 2008 / 2009, your company paved the\\nway for electric mobility. The ultra-sustainable BMW i3 * was ahead of its time – and is\\nstill performing well in the marketplace to this day.\\nPhase II of our transformation – strategic focus on electrification, digitalisation and\\ndeveloping expertise.\\nWe are currently leveraging the full potential of global differences in demand with\\nour wide range of products and drivetrains. The popular BMW X3 will be joined by\\nthe high-volume BMW 5 Series, X1 and 7 Series models, each with a choice of four\\ndrivetrain technologies. Our plants are capable of building different drivetrains on the\\nsame production line. By the end of 2022, each of our German vehicle plants will be\\nproducing at least one fully electric vehicle. This is what flexibility looks like at BMW!\\nWe are enabling our team by developing expertise and reallocating competences. We\\nplan to take everyone along with us. This year alone, we will be training 75,000 participants in future areas of activity and new fields of expertise like robotics, data analytics,\\nagile software development, AI, autonomous driving and, of course, e-mobility.\\n\\n26\\n\\nElectrifying the BMW Group.\\nWe are also stepping up electric mobility to keep pace with growing demand. Our\\nroadmap is ambitious: Your company aims to have delivered more than a million vehicles with battery-electric or plug-in hybrid drive trains to customers by the end of\\nthis year. We will have 25 electrified models on the roads by 2023 – targeting our large\\nhigh-volume models, in particular. By 2025, electrified vehicles will comprise at least a\\nquarter of our sales volume. We also see potential in fuel cells and are supporting the\\ncreation of hydrogen infrastructure in Germany. A small series of the BMW i Hydrogen\\nNEXT is planned from 2022.\\nBMW iX and i4 will revolutionise the market in 2021.\\nMany customers are eagerly awaiting the new fully electric BMW iX * and i4 models.\\nBoth vehicles have a strong emotional appeal straight from the heart of the BMW brand. In\\nthe iX we have perfectly integrated hardware and software in the form of shy tech. Just as\\nour customers would expect from us: in a simple, intuitive and precise manner. We want\\nto excite people with innovations and at the same time inspire them. The new BMW iDrive\\ntransforms the iX *, just like every future BMW model, into a digital powerhouse.\\nPhase III of our transformation – what will define a BMW in the year 2030?\\nWe aim to deliver at least seven million electrified vehicles to customers by 2030. To\\ncoincide with the next surge in e-mobility, we will be launching our new cluster architecture, which is uncompromisingly centred on fully electric drivetrains, in the middle\\nof the decade, starting at our new plant in Hungary. We believe the next dimension of\\ndigital connectivity is closely tied to this: in the vehicle, in production and throughout\\nour company processes.\\nSustainability is the common thread.\\nAchieving consistent, sustainable development will also give us a competitive edge.\\nIn 2012, we set ourselves ten sustainability goals up to 2020. Today, we are able to say:\\nmission accomplished. Let me give you three examples:\\n1. We halved the CO₂ emissions of our European new vehicle fleet between 1995 and\\n2020.\\n2. Our plants worldwide exclusively source green electricity. As of 2021, they will even\\nproduce completely CO₂-neutral on balance.\\n\\n* See\\n\\nFuel Consumption and CO2 Emissions Information.\\n\\n3. The percentage of women in management functions at the BMW Group is above\\nour target range.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nTo Our Stakeholders\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nStatement of the Chairman of the Board of Management\\n\\nWe don’t just do sustainability at BMW: We are making BMW sustainable.\\nWe now find ourselves on the next stage of the journey – pursuing a verifiable\\nand consistent path towards climate neutrality by 2050. In July 2020, we adopted our\\nintegrated sustainability strategy, with concrete science-based targets for the first stage\\nup to 2030. How are we different from other companies? The answer to that is simple:\\nwe are substantially reducing our carbon footprint along the entire value chain. The\\naim is for life cycle CO₂ emissions per vehicle to be lowered by at least a third. This will\\nbe achieved through innovation, not offsets. In this way, we can drastically reduce the\\ncarbon footprint compared to 2019 per vehicle by 2030:\\n\\n— In production by 80 percent.\\n\\n27\\n\\nOur clear claim\\n\\nGREENEST\\nELECTRIC VEHICLE comes\\nFROM BMW.

Instead, we are reversing this trend and lowering emissions.\\nOur aim is to create the most sustainable supply chain in our industry. We have already\\nagreed with our suppliers that they will only use green power to produce battery cells.\\nThis measure alone adds up to about ten million tonnes less CO₂ over the next ten years.\\nClimate-neutral business model spanning the entire value chain by 2050.\\nWe are already looking ahead into the future and intend to close the material cycle\\nfurther – for instance, by increasing the percentage of secondary material in our vehicles.\\nThis lowers CO₂ emissions significantly compared to using primary material.

This is what sets\\nthe BMW Group apart.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nTo Our Stakeholders\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nStatement of the Chairman of the Board of Management\\n\\nDear Shareholders,\\nThe coronavirus pandemic has shown very clearly how important cars are to people.\\nDemand should continue to increase overall. We aim to get sales back towards their\\npre-pandemic levels by the end of the year. We always take a long-term perspective.\\nAll our decisions are geared towards adding value, profitability and growth in close\\ncombination with sustainability, climate protection and secure jobs. On this basis, your\\ncompany will remain a safe and attractive investment, focused on added value creation.\\nOur entrepreneurial independence is a valuable commodity for us. From this position, we can create a new mobility for our customers. We will be investing more than\\n€ 30 billion in research and development – and the future of your company – by 2025.\\nThat alone shows how fully confident we are.\\nJoin us in embarking on this promising decade!\\n\\nOLIVER ZIPSE\\nChairman of the Board of Management\\n\\n28\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nTo Our Stakeholders\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nDialogue with Stakeholders\\n\\nDIALOGUE WITH\\nSTAKEHOLDERS\\nSTAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT\\n\\nThe BMW Group is an enterprise that operates on\\na global scale within a complex environment subject to\\ncrucial interdependencies. Business activities have an\\nexternal impact and can affect the interests of many\\nindividual stakeholders as well as various categories of\\nstakeholders. Conversely, developments occurring across\\nsociety as a whole can influence the Group’s business\\nactivities, both directly and indirectly. Against this backdrop, the BMW Group maintains a regular dialogue with\\nits stakeholders in all key markets on a variety of topics.\\nThe aim at all times is to achieve a better understanding of the positions of stakeholders and in turn provide\\nthem with greater insight into the BMW Group’s activities. In pursuing this aim, the BMW Group does not shy\\naway from critical topics and debates, but endeavours to\\nfind solutions via a constructive dialogue with stakeholders in the best interests of all concerned.\\n\\n29\\n\\nIn its interaction with stakeholders, the BMW Group\\nuses its own dialogue formats as well as participating\\nconstructively in public debates. For example, the Group\\nhas been represented at UN climate conferences for many\\nyears.\\nThe basis for the BMW Group’s engagement with\\nstakeholders is set out in its Stakeholder Engagement Policy.\\nThe document defines dialogue objectives, sets out the\\ncriteria for identifying and prioritising stakeholders, and\\nspecifies suitable dialogue formats as well as forms of\\ncommunication.\\n\\nBMW GROUP DIALOGUES\\n\\nBMW Group Dialogues are among the main formats for\\ninteracting with stakeholders and have been held regularly since 2011. Above all, they provide an opportunity\\nto sound out current and impending corporate strategic\\ndecisions compared with stakeholder expectations. Major\\ntopics covered in recent years have included electric mobility, the Group’s energy strategy, corporate citizenship,\\nurban mobility, and environmental and social standards\\nin the supply chain.\\n\\nGenerally, BMW Group Dialogues are held annually\\nin the BMW Group’s key sales regions of North America,\\nEurope and Asia. Stakeholder feedback is documented\\nand incorporated in the Group’s strategic considerations\\nalongside other key factors.\\n\\nPARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND\\nWORK IN ASSOCIATIONS\\n\\nThe BMW Group maintains an active, open and\\ntransparent dialogue with policy makers, union representatives, associations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The aim is to play a constructive and\\ntransparent role in helping shape the general political\\nframework regarding the company’s business activities.\\nIn this context, the BMW Group offers its expertise to\\npromote fair competition for all those involved and find\\nviable solutions.\\nThe BMW Group has political offices in a number of\\nmajor cities, including Berlin, Brussels, Washington DC\\nand Beijing, giving it a worldwide presence for expressing its opinions on environmental, financial and social\\npolicy issues. The BMW Group always adopts a clear\\nposition, which it communicates in a transparent manner\\nto external parties, regardless of the target audience it\\nis addressing.\\nApart from its own activities in terms of public policy development, the BMW Group is also a member of\\nnumerous associations in various countries. Membership\\nis voluntary in the majority of cases, although there are\\nsome situations in which it is necessary to join associations in order to comply with legal requirements.\\nThe BMW Group puts forward its own standpoints\\nwith a view to helping shape association policies. However, this does not mean that the Group’s opinions\\nalways fully coincide with those of the associations. If\\nthere are any major differences, the Group considers the\\nbest options available for best dealing with the situation.\\nBMW Group Cooperation Policy for Trade, Industry & Car Manufacturer\\nAssociations\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nTo Our Stakeholders\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nDialogue with Stakeholders\\n\\nAt the beginning of 2021, the BMW Group assumed\\nthe presidency of the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA). The Association collaborates\\nwith a wide range of institutional, non-governmental\\nresearch and civil society organisations as well as with a\\nnumber of industry associations. The year 2021 is seen\\nas a crucial point for the automotive industry within the\\nEuropean Union in terms of transitioning to sustainable\\nmobility. The current focus of the ACEA agenda is therefore on topics such as climate protection, emissions, connected and automated driving, sustainability, research\\nand innovation, economy and safety.\\nIn the interest of transparency, the BMW Group always discloses the most important association memberships on its website BMW Group Memberships. Furthermore,\\nall topics that are discussed at EU level are publicly\\navailable in the EU Transparency Register.\\n\\nFINANCIAL MARKET PRESENCE WITH SUSTAINABILITY\\nCREDENTIALS\\n\\nRegular in-depth dialogue with capital market participants has always been a high priority for the BMW Group.\\nWithin a short space of time, sustainability has become a\\nkey driver for the financial market. Investors and analysts\\nare increasingly considering environmental, social and\\ngovernance (ESG) aspects in their investment recommendations and decision-making processes.\\nFor many years now, its top rankings in prestigious\\ncapital market sustainability indexes have borne out the\\nBMW Group’s leading role among automobile manufacturers. In 2020, for instance, the BMW Group was\\n\\n30\\n\\nranked first in the automotive category of the Dow Jones\\nSustainability Indices World and Europe. The Group also\\nattaches particular importance to remaining in direct\\ncontact with investors and analysts. These dialogues are\\ncurrently focused on the BMW Group’s sustainability\\nstrategy, the related progress updates and the ambitious targets the Group has set itself to reduce carbon\\nemissions across the entire value chain. These topics are\\ndiscussed in face-to-face meetings and conversations as\\nwell as at (sometimes virtual) roadshows and conferences\\nheld at key international financial centres.\\nAgainst the backdrop of the Paris Climate Agreement,\\npolicymakers in Europe are also increasingly adopting a\\nholistic approach to dealing with climate protection and\\nsustainability issues. For example, the EU Action Plan\\nfor Sustainable Finance aims to redirect capital flows\\ntowards sustainable economic activities. Financial risks\\narising from factors such as climate change, resource\\nscarcity and environmental degradation are set to be\\ngiven greater prominence, and new approaches are\\nbeing developed to manage these risks. There are also\\ncalls to promote greater transparency and long-termism\\nregarding financial and economic activity.\\nIn June 2020, as a key aspect of the EU Action Plan,\\nthe EU Parliament adopted a regulation to introduce a\\nuniform classification system (taxonomy) for environmentally sustainable economic activities within the EU,\\nwith a view to achieving a sustainable allocation of capital. The Taxonomy Regulation also extends the relevant\\nreporting requirements to companies covered by the EU\\nCSR Directive. From the 2021 reporting year onwards,\\ncompanies affected are required to disclose information\\non revenues, capital expenditure and operating expenses\\nrelating to economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable, based on the stipulated taxonomy.\\n\\nThe BMW Group attaches great importance to the EU\\nTaxonomy Directive and is currently preparing for the\\nnew requirements in a Group-wide project.\\nSustainability is also an important factor for the\\nBMW Group when it comes to investing pension fund\\nassets. At the end of 2019, the Group took a pivotal\\ndecision to apply sustainability criteria to investments\\nheld by its German pension fund. The current focus is\\non measuring the carbon footprint of significant parts of\\nthese assets on the one hand and the risks attached to\\ntheir future performance on the other.\\nConcurrently, numerous benchmarks for investing\\nin liquid assets have been replaced by ESG-optimised\\nindices. Regarding the non-liquid portion of pension\\nassets, a fixed amount has been reserved for upcoming\\ninvestments that are intended to have a measurable,\\npositive impact on the environment or society in general that are not based on yield considerations alone\\n(impact investments). In addition to climate protection,\\nthe investments made to date are largely based on the\\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out by the\\nUN such as health, well-being, affordable clean energy,\\nand sustainable consumption and production.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nTo Our Stakeholders\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nDialogue with Stakeholders\\n\\n31\\n\\nKEY TOPICS IN 2020\\n\\nKey topics raised by the BMW Group with stakeholders\\nincluded:\\n\\nThe BMW Group’s interaction with stakeholders includes topics brought to its attention by stakeholders as\\nwell as those in which it proactively engages in dialogue.\\n\\n— The Group’s new corporate strategy objectives\\n— Environmental and social standards in the supply\\nchain\\n\\nKey issues raised by BMW Group stakeholders in\\n2020 included:\\n\\n— Carbon emissions in the supply chain\\n\\n— Climate protection, particularly carbon emissions\\n\\n— Support for electric mobility and the comprehensive\\n\\n— Human rights in the supply chain, particularly regarding the procurement of raw materials for electric\\nmobility applications\\n\\n— Illegal deforestation\\n— Lobbying in associations\\n— Sustainable finance\\n\\nexpansion of charging infrastructure\\n\\n— Political control over emissions limits without discriminating against individual drivetrain technologies and vehicle concepts\\n\\n— Continued development of the regulatory framework\\nfor automated driving and digital networks\\n\\n— Support for new efficiency-enhancing technologies\\n— Realistic relationship between emissions targets and\\nemission measurement methods\\n\\n— Consistency between supply-side and demand-side\\ndecarbonisation policies\\n\\n— Ensuring a sufficient supply of critical raw materials\\n— Trade policy and free trade agreements\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nTo Our Stakeholders\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nDialogue with Stakeholders\\n\\nTHE NEXT STEPS:\\n\\n32\\n\\nSTAKEHOLDER GROUPS AND FORMS OF DIALOGUE\\nDialogue, conferences and technology workshops with investors and analysts\\n\\nThe BMW Group intends to continue interacting with\\nits stakeholders throughout 2021.

Also in March, the rating agency Standard\\n& Poor’s (S&P) lowered its credit rating from A+ to A,\\nwhile leaving the outlook at negative.\\n\\nWith its above-average ratings overall, the\\nBMW Group continues to enjoy good access to international capital markets and is also benefiting from highly\\nattractive refinancing conditions.\\n\\nBoth agencies cite the negative trend in profitability\\nand free cash flow as the reason for the downgrade by\\none rating level.

For some time\\nnow, the rating agencies have highlighted the major challenges currently facing the entire automotive industry in\\ngeneral. In light of developments in 2020, the agencies\\ntook the opportunity to reassess the credit ratings of their\\nentire portfolio of automobile manufacturers. The more\\nrigorous assessment resulted in a significant number of\\nnegative outlooks and downgrades being announced in\\nthe course of recent months.\\n\\nThe negative outlook for the long-term ratings reflects\\nthe general uncertainty regarding future developments\\nand the potentially adverse impact of the coronavirus\\npandemic. In light of the prevailing circumstances, the\\nagencies see a potentially negative impact on automobile\\nsales, profitability and free cash flow across the automotive sector.\\nAt the same time, however, the short-term ratings for\\nBMW AG were confirmed by both Moody’s (P-1) and S&P\\n(A-1) and therefore remain at a high level.\\nThe BMW Group is already benefiting from its\\nrigorous working capital and capital expenditure management. The Automotive segment’s free cash flow, for\\ninstance, exceeded market expectations not only in the\\nfourth quarter 2020, but also for the financial year as a\\nwhole, with the EBIT margin again nearing the strategic\\ntarget range of between 8 and 10 %.\\n\\nThe BMW Group again achieved top rankings in\\nprestigious sustainability ratings in 2020, underlining\\nits strong position in this area. In 2020, for instance, the\\nBMW Group was named sector leader in the Automobiles\\ncategory of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices World\\nand Europe. It is also in the top grouping (Climate A\\nList) of the CDP ratings list (formerly Carbon Disclosure\\nProject) for the transparency of its carbon emissions\\nreporting. Furthermore, the Group was again listed in\\nthe British FTSE4Good Index in 2020, is also listed by\\nMSCI, Sustainalytics and ISS-Oekom and holds a leading\\nposition in its sector in each case.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nTo Our Stakeholders\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nBMW Stock and Capital Markets in 2020\\n\\nDIVIDEND BELOW PREVIOUS YEAR’S LEVEL – PAYOUT\\nRATIO REMAINS STABLE\\n\\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory\\nBoard will propose to the Annual General Meeting that\\nthe unappropriated profit of BMW AG amounting to\\n€ 1,253 million (2019: € 1,646 million) be used to pay a\\ndividend of € 1.90 per share of common stock (2019:\\n€ 2.50) and a dividend of € 1.92 for each share of preferred\\nstock (2019: € 2.52).

The BMW Group bases its contribution\\nto the sustainable development of our planet on scientifically derived criteria. With this principle in mind, it\\ncombines ecological and social aspects with securing its\\nlong-term future in all its activities. The BMW Group\\nviews the combination of driving pleasure and responsibility for acting sustainably as a clear factor for differentiation. The outcome is that customers experience\\noutstanding innovative products made by a company\\nfocused on sustainability.\\nHowever, that is merely the starting point for the\\nBMW Group, which intends to integrate sustainability\\nmore strongly than ever in its corporate strategy. The\\nstrategy establishes the necessary conditions to fulfill\\nboth customer expectations and regulatory requirements\\nregarding emissions in the Group’s various markets by\\noffering a wide range of products. Its clear ambition is to\\nensure that all areas of the company think, manage and\\ndemonstrably act in a true spirit of sustainability.\\nThis way of thinking has resulted in the BMW Group\\nreaching the logical strategic decision to move away from\\npursuing a separate sustainability strategy and presenting a separate sustainable value report. Sustainability is\\n\\n41\\n\\nthe basic pattern that shapes the BMW Group’s strategy.\\nFrom beginning to end, activities and plans should comprehensively be examined with regard to their economic,\\necological and social impacts and the corresponding\\ndecisions taken based on an integrated approach. With\\neffect from the financial year 2020, the Group is therefore integrating its reporting. A Group Report of this\\nnature covers a variety of key aspects and endeavours\\nto highlight correlations in a transparent manner. The\\nBMW Group is therefore consciously subjecting all of its\\nactivities to a comprehensive external audit, including\\nits activities in the area of sustainability.\\n\\nTHE STRATEGY ARROW – POINTING THE WAY\\nTO THE FUTURE\\n\\nThe BMW Group’s strategy comprises four key elements, which are summarised in a strategy arrow that\\npoints towards the future.\\n\\nPosition\\nDirection\\n\\nStrategic\\napproach\\n\\nCollaboration\\n\\nPOSITION – WHAT DOES THE BMW GROUP\\nSTAND FOR?\\n\\nThe BMW Group stands for first-class individual\\nmobility and sustained responsibility. These factors provide transparency and reliability for shareholders and\\ninvestors as well as for partners in the supply chain and\\nthe production and sales system, but also for all other\\nstakeholders, political decision makers, the media and\\nthe general public.\\nThe BMW Group considers itself as a pioneer and\\nsets standards for the individual mobility of tomorrow. It\\ncombines joy and responsibility without compromise and,\\ntogether with its partners, leads the industry in terms\\nof environmental, social and integrity standards. The\\nBMW Group is committed to complying with the Paris\\nClimate Agreement – with a verifiable track record of\\ncontinuous improvement. It is promoting the principles\\nof circular economy, both in its corporate philosophy and\\nin close collaboration with its partners – from the supply\\nchain to production, the use phase and the recycling of\\nits products.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nGeneral Information and Group Profile\\n\\nDIRECTION – WHAT IS THE BMW GROUP’S\\nDRIVING FORCE?\\n\\nIts aspiration to manufacture products that will inspire its customers – both today and in the future. That is\\nthe force that drives the BMW Group. At the same time,\\nthe Group strives to achieve a high level of profitability\\nin order to safeguard its corporate independence and\\ndistinctively shape the mobility trends of the future. The\\nintegration of ecological and social aspects throughout\\nits entire value chain ensures the continued viability of\\nthe BMW Group going forward.\\nThe Group is built on a firm foundation of strong\\nbrands and emotional products. In the face of increasingly fierce competition, the BMW Group continues to hone\\nits brand profiles and express them, among other ways,\\nin a unique, characteristic automotive design language.\\nDesign arouses emotions and emotion drives desire. At\\nthe BMW Group, outstanding design always follows\\nfunction. The kidney-shaped grille of the new BMW iX,\\nfor example, takes on a new role as a smart surface that\\nnot only conceals new technologies, but has the ability\\nto self-heal due to the use of innovative materials, so that\\nslight scratches disappear by themselves. Innovation and\\n\\n42\\n\\nThe products must deliver what their design promises, i. e. sportiness, quality and emotionality, a fact\\nthat applies equally to all drivetrain technologies. The\\nBMW Group is a leading supplier of electrified vehicles,\\nthe foundation for which was laid at an early stage by\\nproject i with the all-electric BMW i3 in 2013. Meanwhile, the Group is in the middle of its second phase:\\nIn order to keep pace with growing market demand, it\\nis expanding its offering of electric drivetrains across all\\nsegments. With its flexible platforms and the fifth generation of in-house developed fully electric drivetrains,\\nthe BMW Group can offer its customers worldwide a\\nbroad and mature range of products. For example, the\\nall-electric MINI Cooper SE * and the BMW iX3 * were\\nboth launched in the course of 2020 and will be followed\\nby the BMW i4 and the BMW iX * in 2021.\\nIn future, models such as the high-volume BMW 5 Series and the X1 as well as the BMW 7 Series will be available\\nwith four different types of drivetrain – all-electric, plug-in\\nhybrid, petrol and diesel. Moreover, the BMW Group is\\npreparing for the third phase of its transformation with a\\nnew vehicle architecture starting in the mid-2020s. Over\\nthe next ten years, the Group intends to have more than\\nseven million of its electrified vehicles on roads worldwide – at least two-thirds of them all-electric models.\\n\\nCustomer Orientation\\n\\n* See\\n\\nFuel Consumption and CO2 Emissions Information.\\n\\nWith this aim in mind, the BMW Group is systematically expanding its product range and progressively\\nenhancing both its technologies and its vehicle architectures, the latest of which are entirely centred on fully\\nelectric drivetrain systems. At the same time, the Group\\nis taking another major step in terms of digitalised connectivity, not only within the vehicle itself, but also in\\nits corporate processes.\\nAs part of its Performance Programme, the BMW\\nGroup is also working to continuously raise its level of\\nefficiency in order to compensate for the high upfront\\nexpenditures required for the technologies that will shape\\nthe world of tomorrow. Profitability and free cash flow\\nhave a high priority within the BMW Group’s corporate\\nmanagement system. All the measures and initiatives it\\ntakes are therefore aimed at continually developing its\\nstrong economic base.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nGeneral Information and Group Profile\\n\\nMoreover, to express the importance of its ability to\\nperform in economic terms, the BMW Group has set itself ambitious financial targets in the course of realigning\\nits strategy. In future, the key performance indicators\\n(KPIs) already used in the annual outlook, namely\\n1. Profit before financial result as a percentage of Automotive segment revenues (EBIT margin Automotive\\nsegment) and\\n2. Return on capital employed for the Automotive segment (RoCE Automotive segment)\\nwill also be integrated as KPIs at the strategic level.

Group profit before tax as a percentage of Group\\nrevenues (BMW Group EBT margin).\\nWith this strategy, the BMW Group intends to generate a Group EBT margin in excess of 10 %.

During the coronavirus pandemic year\\n2020, for example, advances in digitalisation enabled\\nthe BMW Group to maintain direct contact with its customers, despite lockdowns worldwide. Digitalisation is\\nhelping to shorten the process of developing new vehicle\\nmodels by up to one-third. When the BMW Group transitions to the more advanced smart vehicle architectures in\\n2021, the conventional drivetrain variants will be largely\\nphased out to make way for electrified drivetrains such\\nas mild hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric systems.\\nThese results will already begin to take effect from 2022.\\n\\nThe BMW Group places the strategic emphasis on its\\ncustomers and their varying requirements worldwide. In\\nthe BMW Group, trendsetting technologies, emotional\\nproducts and individualised customer service merge to\\ncreate a unique overall experience for customers.\\n\\nMoreover, as one of its efficiency initiatives, the\\nGroup regularly assesses how complexity can be reasonably reduced. Complexity arises due to increasingly\\nstrict and globally heterogeneous regulatory requirements. The Group-wide Performance Programme also\\nincludes making the most of synergies and efficiencies\\nin indirect purchasing as well as in terms of materials\\nand production costs. And it goes without saying that\\nthe BMW Group is selectively bolstering its performance\\nwith attractive new models – especially in segments generating the highest returns.\\n\\nIts strategy is therefore of a dynamic nature. On the\\none hand, the Group’s market environment is characterised by stable trends. This includes people’s need for\\nindividual mobility, which the BMW Group is convinced\\nwill remain strong and grow further in the years to come.\\nOn the other hand, however, it needs to be able to respond to uncertain developments both flexibly and with\\na sense of proportion. These developments can be of a\\n(geo)political nature, but also come in the form of fully\\nunexpected events such as the coronavirus pandemic.\\nIn 2020, the Board of Management realigned the core\\nelements of the BMW Group’s strategy and focused them\\non the key technology areas that are expected to shape\\nthe future.\\nInnovative technologies are the key to the future\\nof mobility going forward. By 2025, the BMW Group\\nintends to invest more than € 30 billion in research\\nand development to reinforce its role as a leader of\\ninnovation. The Group’s plans are also an expression\\nof confidence in terms of the way it sees business developing going forward. Its ability to integrate a broad\\nvariety of technologies in an overall system is of crucial\\nimportance. Companies that succeed in mastering and\\ncombining both hardware and software in equal measure\\nare those which will shape the future of the automobile\\nin the long term.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nGeneral Information and Group Profile\\n\\n44\\n\\nHOW DOES THE BMW GROUP\\nENSURE COOPERATION?\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY PLACED AT CORE\\nOF CORPORATE STRATEGY\\n\\nTo achieve its strategic goals, the entire team of some\\n121,000 employees worldwide needs to work in a spirit\\nof cooperation to implement the strategy, based on the\\nprinciples of responsibility, appreciation, transparency,\\ntrust and openness. The BMW Group therefore works\\nhand in glove with both internal and external partners\\nwith the twin aims of achieving maximum effectiveness\\nand joint success.\\n\\nSustainability is intrinsic to the BMW Group’s strategic orientation. At the end of July 2020, the Board of\\nManagement of BMW AG announced the first details of\\nthis strategy and presented targets to which the enterprise will remain committed for the period up to 2030.\\nIn this endeavour, the BMW Group is building on a solid\\nfoundation. In recent years and decades, it has also repeatedly set standards in sustainability that are acknowledged by external, independent bodies. In 2020, for\\nexample, the BMW Group took back industry leadership\\nin the automotive sector in the Dow Jones Sustainability\\nIndices World and Europe. The BMW Group therefore\\noccupies the top spot among automotive manufacturers\\nDialogue with Stakeholders. It is also in the top CDP grouping\\nfor its transparent disclosure of carbon emissions. The\\nprinciple of continuous improvement has always been a\\nkey aspect of the BMW Group's strategy.\\n\\nThe Group needs to tackle the entrepreneurial,\\neco logical and social challenges in equal measure to\\naccomplish these aims. Decisions need to be analysed\\nwith regard to their interactions and consequences in the\\noverall context. Success is not something to be simply\\ntaken for granted, but has to be worked for every day\\nanew. Everyone needs to work hard for “their” company\\nand deliver maximum performance in order to reach the\\ncommon goal. Success in corporate terms is always the\\njoint success of all BMW Group employees together with\\ntheir partners. For this reason, it is also a key aspiration\\nof the BMW Group to be an attractive employer.\\n\\nThe Group has therefore given a commitment to\\nachieve climate neutrality across the entire value chain\\nby no later than 2050. In view of the long-term nature\\nof its targets and the fact that, from today’s perspective,\\n\\nthe technological and economic route remains uncertain,\\nthe BMW Group sets its targets one decade at a time.\\nIn 2020, for example, the Group set itself specific goals\\nfor the year 2030 based on scientific information. New\\nscience-based targets have emerged from the initiative of\\nthe same name (SBTI). These targets are fully in line with\\nthe requirements of the Paris Climate Agreement and put\\nthe BMW Group on the path towards climate neutrality.\\nCarbon emissions are to be reduced by at least\\none-third per vehicle over the entire life cycle, from the\\nsupply chain to production to the end-of-life phase.

The BMW Group has been\\nworking successfully for many years to reduce the level\\nof carbon emissions of its new vehicle fleet worldwide.\\nAs well as complying with its legal obligations, the Group\\nhas always remained true to its voluntary commitments.\\nThe early deployment of Efficient Dynamics technologies\\nsince 2007 and the ongoing electrification of its vehicle\\nfleet form the dual basis for continued compliance with\\nstatutory carbon emissions and fuel consumption limits\\ngoing forward.\\nAs a pioneer of electric mobility, the BMW Group is\\nin the process of significantly expanding its range. By\\nthe end of 2021, it aims to have over one million vehicles powered by either all-electric or plug-in hybrid\\ndrivetrains on the road. BMW Group customers will\\nthen be able to choose from a range of five fully electric\\nseries-produced models.\\n\\n47\\n\\nThe BMW Group intends to have 25 electrified models on the road by 2023. The plan is based on flexible\\nvehicle architectures and production systems that enable\\na model to be manufactured as an all-electric version, as\\na plug-in hybrid or powered by a conventional internal\\ncombustion engine. This approach gives the BMW Group\\nthe flexibility to take account of changes in market demand as well as differences in regulatory requirements\\nand infrastructure in the various markets in which it\\noperates. The BMW Group forecasts that demand for\\nits electrified vehicles is set to double by 2021 compared\\nto 2019. According to the BMW Group’s forecasts, by\\n2021 the sale of electrified vehicles is expected to double\\ncompared to 2019 figures. By 2025, the proportion of\\nelectrified cars in total Group deliveries is expected to\\nrise to at least 25 %. However, Group decarbonisation\\ntargets are far more ambitious. By 2030, it aims to reduce\\ncarbon emissions per kilometre driven during a given\\nvehicle’s use phase by more than 40 % compared to 2019\\n(Scope 3 downstream). Carbon Emissions and Pollutants The\\ntarget is within the range defined by the SBTI’s calculations to limit global warming to between 1.5 and 1.75\\ndegrees Celsius.\\n\\nCARBON EMISSIONS IN PRODUCTION AND AT BUSINESS\\nLOCATIONS BY 80 %\\n\\nThe BMW Group has a direct influence on the carbon\\nemissions generated at its own plants and locations and\\nhas therefore been a leader in terms of resource efficiency\\nin this field for many years. Its underlying aspiration\\nis even more ambitious than the international pursuing\\nefforts of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\\nDespite having already reduced the level of carbon\\nemissions per vehicle produced by more than 70 %\\nsince 2006, the BMW Group intends to additionally\\nreduce carbon emissions per vehicle produced, which\\nare generated directly by its own combustion processes (Scope 1) and indirectly by external energy sources\\n(Scope 2), by a further 80 % by 2030 (base year 2019).\\nAccordingly, by 2030 carbon emissions are expected to\\nhave dropped by over 90 % compared with 2006 levels.\\nResource Consumption and Resource Efficiency\\n\\nAlongside the purchase of electricity, 100 % of which\\nhas been obtained from green, renewable sources * since\\n2020, Renewable Energy the BMW Group will continue to\\nsystematically invest in optimising its energy efficiency\\nand also intends to exploit the opportunities offered by\\ndigitalisation in the process. Even today, the Group’s\\nproduction processes are already highly efficient – for\\nexample, by reducing the volume of rejects in car body\\nconstruction to a minimum and by planning the ongoing maintenance of its machinery on a predictive basis.\\nThe BMW Group will also examine the potential for the\\nbroader deployment of renewable energy at its various\\nlocations worldwide.

Due to the greater proportion of electrified\\nvehicles, carbon emissions generated per vehicle in the\\nBMW Group’s supply chain are set to rise by more than\\none-third by 2030 if no countermeasures are taken. At\\nthe same time, as the volume of carbon emissions generated during the use phase decreases, the total percentage\\nof emissions caused by the supply chain and attributable\\nto the Group will increase. This situation requires the\\nBMW Group to set its own strategic targets.\\nThe Group not only aims to halt the rise in the level\\nof carbon generated by the supply chain that would be\\nexpected without taking countermeasures (Scope 3 upstream), it also intends to reduce emissions per vehicle\\nby at least 20 % * by 2030 (base year 2019). In its efforts to\\nachieve this aim, among other measures the BMW Group\\nis establishing the carbon footprint of the supply chain\\nas a decision-making criterion when awarding contracts.\\nWith this end in mind, the Group took the step of initiating a dialogue with its most important suppliers in terms\\nof their carbon footprint during the period under report.\\nThe BMW Group is playing an exemplary role in working\\nwith well-documented and measurable carbon emission\\ntargets for its supply chain.\\n\\n* Value rounded for simplification purposes. The target percentage validated in conjunction with SBTI is 22 %.\\n\\n48\\n\\nAs a concrete example of the measures taken, the\\nGroup has already entered into contractual agreements\\nwith its cell manufacturers that only green electricity will\\nbe used to produce the fifth generation of battery cells, a\\nmove that should lead to a total saving of around ten million tonnes of carbon dioxide over the next ten years.\\nMoreover, the BMW Group is currently in the process\\nof creating the organisational conditions that enable it\\nto reliably record and document the size of the carbon\\nfootprint generated via its supply chain. This, in turn, is\\nthe key prerequisite for taking subsequent measures to\\nreduce and effectively manage it, fully in line with the\\nBMW Group’s declared strategy of continuous improvement. Purchasing and Supplier Network\\n\\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial\\nDisclosures (TCFD)\\nIn its reporting procedures, the BMW Group also takes the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial\\nDisclosures (TCFD) into account in order to report transparently on climate risks and opportunities for operational and financial reporting purposes. Firstly, it reports on this topic in detail in\\nits BMW Group Report and secondly in the CDP questionnaire,\\nwhich has incorporated the TCFD recommendations since 2018.\\nThe BMW Group’s 2020 CDP questionnaire is available on the\\nBMW Group Website. The TCFD Index TCFD-Index in the appendix provides a compact overview of the key statements contained in the four TCFD core elements as well as their location in\\nthe BMW Group Report and the CDP questionnaire.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nGeneral Information and Group Profile\\n\\nRESPONSIBLE USE OF RESOURCES – ENTERING THE\\nCIRCULAR ECONOMY\\n\\nNot only decarbonisation but also the responsible\\nuse of resources plays a key part in the BMW Group’s\\nstrategy. In practical terms, this means primarily avoiding\\nwaste or reducing it to an absolute minimum. However,\\nas resources are scarce and many raw materials are only\\navailable in limited quantities, the reuse of materials\\nand raw materials in the form of secondary materials is\\nbecoming increasingly key for manufacturing processes\\ngoing forward.\\nFor example, the growing popularity of electric mobility worldwide cannot be covered by primary materials\\nalone in the long term. Furthermore, there is a strong\\nsynergy between the conservation of primary natural\\nresources and carbon dioxide emissions. Therefore,\\nfrom a sustainability perspective, the underlying flows\\nof resources require some rethinking. The BMW Group\\naims to obtain high-quality secondary materials through\\npromoting a greater degree of transparency in the recycling chain and simultaneously tracing the reuse of\\n(secondary) raw materials within the cycle.\\nThe Group has the clear objective of promoting the circular economy principle by using raw materials even more\\nefficiently in order to protect nature’s finite resources.\\n\\n49\\n\\nEven today, vehicles are already required to be 95 %\\nrecyclable. However, the proportion of secondary raw\\nmaterials used to manufacture new vehicles is still comparatively low. In view of this key point, the BMW Group\\nplans to considerably increase this proportion in its\\nvehicles by 2030 – and is already exploring some very\\nfar-reaching scenarios. The use of secondary materials\\nagain significantly reduces carbon emissions in comparison to primary materials – by as much as 80 % in the case\\nof aluminium, for example. Keeping the extraction of raw\\nmaterials to a minimum is an ideal way of protecting existing resources. In the case of critical raw materials, for\\nexample, any political conflicts in the producing countries could also give rise to risks for the BMW Group’s\\nprocurement activities, which can be mitigated through\\nthe use of secondary products.\\nParticularly in view of the high-voltage batteries\\nneeded to power electrified vehicles, which can entail\\nthe use of critical raw materials, the circular economy\\nhas a decisive role to play. In close collaboration with the\\nGerman recycling specialist Duesenfeld, the BMW Group\\nhas developed a process that can achieve a recycling rate\\nof up to 96 % – including the graphite and electrolytes\\nthese devices contain. The BMW Group already offers all\\ncustomers who own a vehicle equipped with a high-voltage battery to take the devices back free of charge. The\\noffer also applies to regions where it is not legally obliged\\nto do so.\\n\\nIn order to monitor and verify flows of goods on a\\nglobal basis, the BMW Group is also using digital tools\\nin pilot processes, including blockchain technology. The\\nPartChain project, for example, enables the Group to\\ncollect supply chain data using a method that is both\\nverifiable and tamper-proof at all times. In the long term,\\nthis technology could enable critical raw materials in particular to be fully traceable from the mine to the smelter.\\nResource Consumption and Resource Efficiency\\n\\nSECURING LONG-TERM SUCCESS\\n\\nIn order to create value for the BMW Group, the\\nenvironment and society in general, sustainability is\\nintegrated throughout the entire value chain and all\\nits underlying processes. And the evidence of how this\\nGroup strategy is being implemented underlines its tangible impact. It sets out clear guidelines and points the\\nway forward in terms of how the BMW Group intends to\\nshape the individual premium mobility of tomorrow. The\\nBMW Group will move forward in its own independent\\nway and continue the long-term process of developing\\non a sustainable and profitable basis.\\nThe BMW Group’s strategic goals up to the years 2025\\nand 2030 respectively are summarised in the presentation below:\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nGeneral Information and Group Profile\\n\\n50\\n\\nStrategic targets\\n\\n> 10 %\\nEBT MARGIN\\nGROUP\\n\\n8 -10 %\\nEBIT MARGIN\\nAUTOMOTIVE SEGMENT\\n\\n≥ 40 %\\nRETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED\\nAUTOMOTIVE SEGMENT\\n\\n2025\\n\\n2030\\n80 %\\nREDUCTION OF CO ² EMISSIONS\\nPER VEHICLE IN PRODUCTION\\n(BASE YEAR 2019)\\n\\n≥ 25 %\\nMINIMUM PROPORTION OF ELECTRIFIED AUTOMOBILES TO TOTAL\\nDELIVERIES\\n\\n22 %\\nPROPORTION OF WOMEN\\nIN MANAGEMENT POSITIONS\\nIN THE BMW GROUP\\n\\n> 40 %\\nREDUCTION OF CO ² EMISSIONS\\nIN VEHICLE USE PHASE\\nPER KILOMETRE DRIVEN\\n(BASE YEAR 2019)\\n\\n≥ 20 %\\nREDUCTION OF CO ² EMISSIONS\\nIN THE SUPPLY CHAIN\\n(BASE YEAR 2019)\\n\\nThis is a simplified depiction.

In 2019,\\nthe separate format of the Board of Management’s Sustainability Board was fully incorporated into the regular meetings of\\nthe Board of Management, enabling sustainability issues to be\\neven more systematically integrated within the BMW Group’s\\ndecision-making processes. Since then, sustainability has been\\ntreated like every other topic and discussed at Board of Management meetings as the need arises. Moreover, all requests for decisions referred to the Board of Management are required to be\\nassessed beforehand in terms of their sustainability. A Strategy\\nand Structure Circle, comprising the top management of the various company divisions, prepares the drafts of decisions to be taken for the Board of Management after also taking sustainability\\nissues into account.\\n\\nThe BMW Group’s business management system follows a value-based approach that focuses on profitability,\\nconsistent growth, value enhancement for capital providers, sustainability, climate protection and job security.\\nCapital is considered to be employed profitably when the\\namount of profit generated sustainably exceeds the cost\\nof equity and debt capital.

The benchmark and the goal of the BMW Group’s\\nactivities is to identify the wishes of customers worldwide\\nin advance, in order to actively help shape trends and\\nthereby drive transformation – a strategy discerniable in\\nproduction vehicles such as the BMW iX *. In its development work, the BMW Group focuses on two key areas.\\nFirstly, innovative digital solutions that make people’s\\neveryday lives easier and at the same time protect the\\nenvironment, and secondly, as a premium provider in its\\nindustry, the Group sees it as an obligation to offer customers a diverse range of customised, efficient drivetrain\\ntechnologies ranging from all-electric drive systems, to\\nplug-in hybrids and highly efficient internal combustion\\nengines. This also includes hydrogen fuel cell technology,\\nwhich the Group believes could become an additional\\noption in the long term.\\nThe BMW Group’s culture of innovation is most\\ndeeply rooted in its global research and development\\nnetwork. However, innovation is a lot more than that\\nfor the BMW Group: throughout the entire company it\\nis both the basis and the driving force behind the quest\\nto replace the good with the better. Innovative solutions\\nbenefit society in a number of ways: economically, ecologically and socially.\\n\\nFOCUS ON DRIVETRAIN TECHNOLOGIES\\n\\nThe dynamics of the markets in which the\\nBMW Group operates are largely determined by customer\\nexpectations and therefore by demand. The BMW Group\\ntherefore focuses on the wishes and needs of its customers. Market expectations have a direct impact on the\\nrange of vehicles on offer. How big does the vehicle need\\nto be? Which drivetrain variant fits your own lifestyle?\\nFor this reason, the BMW Group offers a broad range\\nof drivetrain systems and aims to offer corresponding\\nelectrified models for all of its brands and for every\\nseries. Ultimately, a business model is successful and\\nsustainable in the long term by offering tailor-made\\nsolutions and assuring customers who are confident in\\ntheir purchasing decisions. Since 2020, the BMW X3 has\\nbeen the benchmark in this regard. It is now available in\\nall four drivetrain variants: as an iX3 * with an all-electric\\ndrivetrain, as a plug-in hybrid or as a model powered by\\na highly efficient diesel or petrol engine.\\n\\n* See\\n\\nFuel Consumption and CO2 Emissions Information.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nGeneral Information and Group Profile\\n\\nTHE FIFTH GENERATION OF ELECTRIC DRIVETRAINS:\\nA MAJOR LEAP IN TERMS OF PRODUCTION AND\\nSUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nCustomer-oriented innovations frequently begin\\nwith basic research. Built up over many years, the\\nBMW Group’s expertise makes sustainable solutions\\npossible. The new, in-house-developed electric motor\\ndoes not contain any rare earth elements. The latest\\ngeneration of batteries requires two-thirds less cobalt\\nthan its predecessors. The BMW Group also considers\\nthe factor of sustainability when sourcing the cobalt it\\nuses. The metal is acquired transparently via a certified\\nprocess and supplied to the battery cell producers for\\nfurther processing. Details are available in the chapter\\nPurchasing and Supplier Network Purchasing and Supplier\\nNetwork. The BMW Group has contractually agreed with\\nthe battery cell suppliers for the fifth generation of its\\neDrive electric drivetrain that only green electricity from\\nrenewable sources will be used in their production processes, which should reduce carbon emissions by some\\nten million tonnes over the next ten years. In this fifth\\ngeneration of the BMW Group’s electric drivetrain, the\\nelectric motor, transmission and power electronics are\\nalso installed within a compact space. The outstanding\\nefficiency of the drivetrain components and the high\\nenergy density of the high-voltage battery enable ranges\\nthat conventional electric vehicles can only achieve with\\nsignificantly larger and correspondingly heavier batteries\\nand therefore lower efficiency. This electric drivetrain\\nwas deployed for the first time in the BMW iX3 *, which\\nwas launched in 2020. From 2021 onwards, further\\nall-electric models such as the BMW iX * or the BMW i4\\nwill be powered by this state-of-the-art technology.\\n* See\\n\\nFuel Consumption and CO2 Emissions Information.\\n\\n63\\n\\nTHE BMW GROUP COVERS THE ENTIRE PROCESS CHAIN\\nFOR ELECTRIC DRIVETRAINS\\n\\nCAN THE HYDROGEN FUEL CELL SERVE AS A BUILDING\\nBLOCK GOING FORWARD?\\n\\nWhether electric motors, high-voltage batteries,\\ncharging equipment or power electronics – since 2011\\nthe BMW Group has gained extensive experience with\\nall the components used in eDrive technology and\\nplaces its emphasis on in-house developments. By the\\nend of 2022, all German vehicle plants will produce at\\nleast one fully electric vehicle. The production system is\\ncapable of manufacturing vehicles either with internal\\ncombustion engines or electric drivetrains on a single\\nline and can therefore also respond flexibly in terms of\\nthe type of drivetrain required by the customer. This\\nlevel of flexibility in production allows the BMW Group\\nto meet customer expectations in an ideal way. At the\\nBMW Group’s Battery Research Centre, work on battery\\ncells is currently focusing on features that provide a high\\ndegree of customer value, including energy density, peak\\npower, longevity, charging properties, costs, behaviour\\nat various temperatures and, last but not least, safety.\\nAt the same time, the BMW Group is building a pilot\\nplant for lithium-ion battery cells near Munich, making\\nthe BMW Group the first automotive manufacturer to\\nsinglehandedly cover the entire process chain of electric\\ndriving and master it in technological terms.\\n\\nThe BMW Group is also investing in the enhanced\\ndevelopment of hydrogen fuel cell technology. The\\nBMW i Hydrogen NEXT, which is based on the X5, already awakened a great deal of interest among visitors\\nat the IAA 2019. In the long term, hydrogen technology\\ncould become a further component in the BMW Group’s\\ndrivetrain range. If the supply of renewably produced\\nhydrogen can be ensured, this technology will provide an\\nattractive option for combining emissions-free mobility\\nwith long-distance capability and short refuelling times.\\nThe BMW Group is convinced that different forms of\\ndrivetrain will continue to exist side by side in the future,\\nas customer expectations cannot be met with a single\\nsolution on an international basis. Beginning in 2022,\\nthe BMW Group will present a low-volume series of the\\nBMW i Hydrogen NEXT featuring the second generation\\nof its hydrogen fuel cell drive system. To make this aim a\\nreality, the BMW Group has been collaborating successfully with Toyota Motor Corporation since 2013. The new\\ndrivetrain technology will be combined with the fifth\\ngeneration of the eDrive, which will then generate its energy from a fuel cell instead of a high-voltage battery. The\\nBMW Group has also developed this technology in-house\\nas an overall system. However, the appropriate political\\nand infrastructural framework conditions first need to be\\ncreated if green hydrogen is to become widely available\\nin sufficient quantities and at competitive prices. Hydrogen can also play a key role in powering heavy-duty\\nand commercial vehicles with the aim of making logistics\\ncarbon-neutral going forward. The BMW Group’s Leipzig\\nand Spartanburg plants have already been using transport vehicles powered by renewably produced hydrogen\\nfor a number of years.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nGeneral Information and Group Profile\\n\\nTHE BMW iX *: ELECTRIC FROM THE GROUND UP\\n\\nIn November 2020, the BMW Group gave the public\\nits first preview of the BMW iX, the first of which are\\nscheduled for delivery to customers in the course of\\n2021. Right from the start, the BMW iX was designed\\nexclusively to provide electric mobility that is suitable for\\neveryday use. The vehicle is powered by the fifth generation of BMW eDrive technology, which the BMW Group\\nhas developed in-house and consists of twin electric\\nmotors, power electronics, charging technology and a\\nhigh-voltage battery produced without the use of rare\\nearths. Fully electric and featuring four-wheel drive\\ntechnology, it will enable ranges of over 600 km in the\\nWLTP cycle. Equipped with innovative charging technology and a highly efficient drivetrain, the BMW iX can be\\ncharged to enable a range of over 120 km in a mere ten\\nminutes. Thanks to the development of new technologies,\\nthe kidney-shaped grille of the BMW iX has now been\\n\\n64\\n\\ngiven a new function as a smart surface where camera\\ntechnology, radar and other sensor-based features are\\nlocated behind a transparent exterior. Through the use\\nof innovative materials, the surface of the grille also has\\na self-healing effect that makes light scratches disappear\\nby themselves. Moreover, as the first 5G-capable model\\nto be made by a premium manufacturer, the BMW iX will\\nalso be the BMW Group’s technology flagship in terms\\nof digitalisation going forward. In addition, gigabit Ethernet technology is being used for the first time in this\\ninnovative vehicle, enabling extremely large volumes of\\ndata from sensors and antennas, for example, to be transmitted through the vehicle within fractions of a second\\nand then processed in the centralised high-performance\\ncomputers of the vehicle’s on-board system. Moreover,\\nsome of this data is also transmitted to the cloud, analysed and returned to the vehicle fleet, depending on\\nthe situation, creating new services for customers. For\\ninstance, information on danger spots detected by these\\nvehicles, such as black ice, will be made available to the\\nentire fleet, as well as tips on where a free parking space\\nis most likely to be found upon arrival. When using all\\nthese digital technology innovations, the BMW Group\\nplaces great emphasis on ensuring that drivers and passengers can perceive and operate new features intuitively,\\neffortlessly and without distraction – regardless of how\\ntechnically complex they may be. These functions are\\nknown as shy tech, i. e. technology that only becomes\\nvisible when needed.\\n\\n* See\\n\\nFuel Consumption and CO2 Emissions Information.\\n\\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE – THE BASIS FOR AUTOMATED\\nDRIVING AND INTERACTION WITH THE VEHICLE\\n\\nSince the end of 2020, over 400 data-driven and\\nAI applications have been helping the BMW Group process and interpret big data throughout all relevant areas\\nof the company. Artificial intelligence is also deployed\\nwhen it comes to developing an algorithm that enables\\nsafe and predictive automated driving features, helping\\nto analyse the approximately 250 million kilometres of\\n“experience” gained to date (as of October 2020). Even\\nnow, BMW Group customers are already experiencing\\nthe capabilities of AI technologies as they drive. Since the\\nend of 2018, an Intelligent Personal Assistant has been\\noffering them support upon request. Since the second\\nhalf of 2020, more than 70 % of BMW vehicles have been\\nequipped with the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant\\nas standard. For example, commands given in natural\\nspeech enable drivers to comfortably operate numerous\\nvehicle functions without having to take their hands off\\nthe steering wheel.\\n\\nCUSTOMER-CENTRIC DEVELOPMENT\\n\\nVia the BMW Group’s international development network, the varying regional needs and requirements of its\\ncustomers worldwide are being incorporated into design,\\nresearch and development. Group locations worldwide\\nare in direct dialogue with their various regions. The\\nBMW Group conducts an average of 70 customer studies\\nper year in the area of display and operating concepts\\nalone. The Group also researches dialogue formats and\\nupcoming trends.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nGeneral Information and Group Profile\\n\\nIn a state-of-the-art innovation process, the\\nBMW Group also uses its ability to change perspectives\\nwhen required. In this respect, it is the first automotive\\nmanufacturer to collaborate with Epic Games, a computer games developer. The BMW Group has modified\\ngaming technologies and adapted them for use in vehicle development as well as in production planning and\\ncustomer presentation at the retail level. In the field of\\nvehicle development, new components and systems can\\ntherefore be tested intensively at a very early stage so\\nthat they can later be used by the customer simply and\\nintuitively to the greatest extent possible. Technologies\\noriginating from the computer games industry such as\\nmixed reality and game engines are key elements that\\nare making an important contribution in this respect.\\nInternationally staffed teams of developers work simultaneously and interactively with one another before\\nhardware prototypes are additionally made available. In\\na mixed reality environment, technical solutions can be\\nanalysed at an early stage on a virtual ride before the\\nfirst samples are made physically available, effectively\\ncutting testing costs and, last but not least, minimising\\ndevelopment times.\\nThe BMW Group operates an international network\\nof research and development locations to ensure that\\nideas can swiftly and directly become innovations for\\ncustomers in the form of ideas to offer. The network\\nprovides the ideal environment for experts to work creatively in internationally connected teams to promote\\nknowledge transfer and even faster, integrated, flexible\\ncollaboration for effectively developing the major trends\\nof the future. This combined network of research and\\ndevelopment expertise is continuously being expanded\\nand strengthened in a competence-oriented manner.\\n\\n65\\n\\nINNOVATION CULTURE IN THE MAKING: A NEW\\nCENTRALISED HUB OF THE BMW GROUP’S GLOBAL\\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT NETWORK COMES\\nINTO BEING.\\n\\nThe Munich Research and Innovation Centre (FIZ)\\nis the main hub of the Group’s international network of\\n14 research and development locations. The first phase\\n\\nof construction completed in the course of enlarging the\\nMunich FIZ went into operation in autumn 2020. On\\nthe FIZ campus, the focus is on transformation and the\\nfuture-related topics of electrification, digitalisation and\\nconnectivity. With over 90 petabytes of storage capacity,\\n100 test benches, 200 laboratories and the directly adjacent prototype construction facility, the FIZ has grown\\nto become one of the largest research and development\\ncentres in Europe.\\n\\nBMW Operating System 7: new features in version 07 / 20\\nDigital key: in collaboration with Apple, the BMW Group is the first car\\nmanufacturer to offer its customers the option of using their iPhone as\\na fully fledged digital car key. It unlocks the vehicle at the door handle\\nand the engine can be started when it is placed in the smartphone compartment. Access rights can be shared with other people and configured in the process and there is a specially designed mode for inexperienced drivers.\\nNavigation / BMW Maps: the cloud-based system has a great many advantages. The route calculation feature combines real-time information with forecast models and therefore acts more dynamically and\\nswiftly than ever. Additional context-based information such as ratings, business opening hours and pictures of interesting places provide BMW Group customers with excellent support. Entering a destination has now been made far more convenient due to the free text\\nfunction, which uses a single search line and adds suggestions for relevant search terms.\\nIntelligent Personal Assistant: the BMW Group has revamped the look\\nof the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant and made it more emotional. The Assistant is able to distinguish between the driver’s and the passenger’s speech, learns and even leans towards the respective conversation partner.\\nApple Car Play allows navigation information from Apple Maps to be\\ndisplayed on both the head-up display and the info display. Google\\nAndroid Auto is also integrated: customers can use functions on their\\n\\nsmartphones wirelessly within the vehicle and access their apps via\\ntouch control without having to directly operate their smartphone. Navigation instructions provided by Google Maps are shown on both the info\\ndisplay and the head-up display.\\nBMW eDrive zones: plug-in hybrids can use geofencing to detect when\\nthey are entering an environmentally restricted zone or a city centre.\\nThey then automatically switch to electric mode after previously ensuring that the vehicle’s battery is fully charged, enabling them to drive locally emissions-free and almost silently where it has the greatest impact.\\nCharging management: electrified models are provided with additional information and services via the Connected Charging feature. Public charging stations and their availability are displayed and additional information is also shown, for example on providers, opening hours\\nor suggestions for places of interest and cafes or restaurants nearby.\\nFinding a parking space: customers can be assisted via various services\\nwhen searching for a parking space. The on-street parking information,\\nfor example, calculates where a parking space is most likely to be free.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nGeneral Information and Group Profile\\n\\n66\\n\\nALWAYS UP TO DATE VIA RADIO INTERFACE\\n\\nINNOVATION IN PRODUCTION\\n\\nINSPIRATION AND COOPERATION\\n\\nThe remote software upgrade function keeps BMW\\nvehicles continuously up to date. The software updates\\ncan be conveniently downloaded to the vehicle whether\\nat home or on the road and contain improvements or\\neven fully new vehicle features. In autumn 2020, the\\nBMW Group rolled out the most extensive remote software upgrade in its history. The free-of-charge improvements and new attractive features were made available\\nover-the-air to more than 750,000 BMW Operating\\nSystem 7 (version 07 / 20) vehicles worldwide.\\n\\nIn production scenarios, innovations can act in two\\ndifferent ways: they serve the purpose of conserving resources and thus further boosting efficiency Production,\\nPurchasing and Supplier Network, but they can also help to\\nimplement new product ideas and design options. Digitalisation is thus also paving the way for completely\\nnew applications that enable owners to customise their\\nvehicles, such as by adding individual equipment features\\nfor the MINI. Furthermore, the BMW Group opened\\nthe Additive Manufacturing Campus in summer 2020.\\nProduction, research and even further training on the\\nsubject of additive manufacturing (i. e. 3D printing) are\\ncombined under one roof at the location. The Campus\\nis also capable of manufacturing components for series\\nproduction vehicles.\\n\\nThe best ideas often come into being when different\\npartners work together. Regional BMW Group Technology Offices are searching for promising young companies\\nworldwide in fields of innovation such as sensor technology, artificial intelligence, battery technology, smart\\nmaterials, natural user interfaces and smart logistics.\\nCooperations in which the strengths of the BMW Group\\ncomplement those of established partners also help to\\nenhance the innovative strength of the BMW Group.\\nCooperations and partnerships For the BMW Group, maintaining its innovation network also includes intensive\\ndialogue with selected colleges and universities. Every\\nyear, thousands of students come to the BMW Group to\\ncomplete an internship or write a scientific thesis. Many\\nGroup employees also work as lecturers at universities\\nand higher education institutions. The BMW Group\\nmaintains close partnerships with six universities and\\nresearch institutions to conduct joint research projects\\nthat combine knowledge transfer with the training of\\nhighly qualified junior staff.\\n\\nMoreover, Remote Software Upgrade allows drivers\\nto purchase and activate additional optional features. For\\nexample, the Highbeam Assist or Active Cruise Control\\nwith the Stop&Go function can also be subsequently installed quickly and easily over the air, even on vehicles\\nthat have already been delivered to customers. Customers\\ncan therefore benefit from the latest technological developments and have the opportunity to test functions that\\nwere not yet needed at the time of purchase for a certain\\nperiod of time with the option to purchase them.\\nApps have been offering customers an effortless\\nconnection between their smartphones and the vehicle\\nsince 2013. A new generation of the My BMW app has\\nbeen available on 30 European markets as well as in\\nChina and Korea since December 2020. My BMW is the\\nnew universal interface to the vehicle and, depending on\\nhow it is equipped, also enables selected features to be\\nactivated remotely, such as vehicle localisation.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nGeneral Information and Group Profile\\n\\nCooperations and partnerships\\n\\nHERE\\n\\nYOUR NOW\\n\\nTo maintain its successful course in the long term, the BMW Group enters into targeted cooperations and partnerships not only with companies\\nfrom the automotive industry, but also with technology leaders from other\\nsectors.

Active\\nand passive safety systems ensure greater safety on the\\nroad – not only for BMW Group customers, but for all\\nother road users, too. When manufacturing its products,\\nthe BMW Group avoids the use of any substances that are\\nhazardous to health. It also informs its customers about\\nall the various safety aspects of its products and enables\\nthem to recognise and handle dangerous situations by\\nproviding driver safety training. The BMW Group ensures transparency, informational self-determination and\\ndata security when using its customers’ data.\\n\\n73\\n\\nFUTURE-ORIENTED DESIGN\\n\\nThe BMW Group is synonymous with future-oriented,\\nemotional vehicle design that unites aesthetics with stateof-the-art technology. It strives to create experiences\\nfor its customers through the design of its vehicles. A\\nsuccessful design makes vehicles coveted products that\\ncater to the individual needs of customers the world over.\\nThe BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad brands\\neach have their own independent design language. Designs created by the BMW Group should not only meet\\nthe high design standards of a globally leading premium\\nautomotive manufacturer, but make technical innovations functional and intuitive to use at the same time.\\nIn order to make future mobility trends perceptible\\nat the earliest stage of design, the BMW Group develops various types of prototypes. Concept vehicles, such\\nas the BMW Concept i4, which was first presented in\\nMarch 2020, are specifically used to communicate in\\nadvance how future series-produced vehicles will look.\\nVision vehicles such as the MINI Vision Urbanaut, which\\nwas unveiled at the BMW Group #NEXTGen event in November 2020, provide the public with a glimpse of how\\nthe Group’s future mobility concepts could be designed.\\n\\nThe globally operating company Designworks is also\\na subsidiary of the BMW Group and an inspiring studio\\nthat works to create thought-provoking design ideas for\\nboth the BMW Group and external customers. In its\\nthree studios in Los Angeles, Munich and Shanghai, it\\ncreates ambitious visions of the future that are meant to\\nshape and improve our world.\\n\\nUSING SAFETY TECHNOLOGY TO MINIMISE RISKS\\n\\nThe BMW Group not only strives to create an emotional connection between products and its customers via\\nits design, it also designs and builds its vehicles to meet\\nthe highest safety standards, as it considers the safety of\\nits vehicles an essential part of its product responsibility.\\nBy including a raft of active and passive safety\\nmeasures, the BMW Group is able to reduce the risk of\\naccidents and injuries not only for vehicle occupants, but\\nfor other road users, too. Above all, these safety measures\\ninclude optimised chassis tuning, highly effective braking\\nsystems, stable passenger compartments and airbags, but\\nalso digital driver assistance systems such as active cruise\\ncontrol, collision warning, lane guidance and emergency\\nbraking assistants.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nProducts and Services\\n\\n74\\n\\nREDUCING POLLUTANTS\\n\\nCOMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION ON SAFETY ASPECTS\\n\\nDATA PROTECTION IS A KEY TASK\\n\\nRight from the design stage of its vehicles, the\\nBMW Group consciously avoids the use of problematic\\nmaterials and substances and takes active steps to keep\\nemissions within the passenger compartment to a minimum. With this design strategy, the BMW Group seeks to\\nensure that legal requirements regarding product safety,\\nhuman health protection and the environment are complied with worldwide for each phase of the product life\\ncycle, including development, use, recycling and disposal.\\nIn addition, all BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brand vehicles are equipped with passenger compartment air filters\\nas standard, which filter out pollutants and particles such\\nas dust or pollen from the outside air.\\n\\nThe BMW Group provides customers with comprehensive information on the correct use of its products\\nand services. Information on health and safety as well\\nas the proper use of its vehicles is provided in printed\\nform in the integrated owner’s manual and is also available electronically via a smartphone app or online. The\\ninformation is supplemented by notes and additional\\nbackground information on services, accessories and\\nvehicle components.\\n\\nThe BMW Group views data protection as one of the\\nmost important tasks of digitalisation. It takes data protection into account at an early stage in the development\\nof its functions and services in order to ensure transparency, informational self-determination and data security\\nfor its customers. In order to maintain this high level\\nof data protection in the long term, the BMW Group’s\\nproducts and services are always developed according to\\nsecurity-by-design principles and continuously tested for\\nsecurity aspects (cybersecurity) throughout their entire\\nlife cycle.\\n\\nDRIVER TRAINING TO PROMOTE GREATER ROAD\\nSAFETY\\n\\nThe BMW Group’s product responsibility also\\nincludes the secure transfer of vehicle data to third\\nparties. For this reason, BMW Group vehicles are not\\ndirectly connected to the Internet, but communicate\\ndirectly and exclusively with the BMW ConnectedDrive\\nback-end service via a secure connection in a virtual\\nprivate network. This precaution minimises the risk of\\nunauthorised third parties gaining access to the vehicle\\nor the driver’s personal data. The point of access to the\\nInternet is controlled via a gateway. The BMW Group\\nconsiders the provision of vehicle data via a secured back\\nend (extended vehicle approach in accordance with ISO\\n20078) the best solution for ensuring data security and\\nthus a high level of data protection.\\n\\nIn 2020, the BMW Group installed passenger compartment filters featuring nanofibre filter technology\\nfor the first time, which keep certain microbial particles\\nand allergens as well as ultra-fine particulate matter from\\nentering the vehicle’s passenger compartment. Also in\\n2020, nanofibre filters were installed for the first time\\nin a Rolls-Royce as standard. From 2021, however, the\\ninnovative technology will gradually become available for\\nnumerous other BMW Group vehicle models.\\n\\nThe BMW Group offers training for BMW and MINI\\nbrand automobiles as well as BMW motorcycles in over\\n30 countries. In the BMW and MINI Driving Experience,\\nit raises awareness of potentially dangerous situations\\nand thus also contributes to road safety in general. Despite global restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic,\\nthe Driving Experience trained over 70,000 participants\\nworldwide at various international locations in 2020.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nProducts and Services\\n\\nIn May 2017, the BMW Group introduced BMW\\nand MINI CarData for the secure transmission of data to\\nthird parties. CarData is already available to BMW and\\nMINI customers across all European markets. Customers can adjust their privacy settings to suit their own\\npersonal needs, either within their vehicles or on the\\nConnectedDrive portal, thereby retaining their right to\\ninformational self-determination. They can decide at any\\ntime which data to share with service providers (such\\nas workshops, insurance companies and fleet managers) in order to receive customised service offers. The\\nBMW Group has also been offering this service in the\\nUSA since April 2020.\\nFurthermore, the Group works closely with the\\nrelevant data protection supervisory authorities to\\nclarify fundamental data protection issues that relate\\nto the increasing connectedness of its vehicles with the\\nenvironment. For example, as a member of the German\\nAssociation of the Automotive Industry (VDA) and\\nthe European Association of the Automotive Industry\\n(ACEA), the BMW Group supports the principles on data\\nprotection they have drawn up. These principles focus\\non transparency, the informational self-determination of\\ncustomers and the technical protection of data in their\\nvehicles.\\n\\n75\\n\\nENSURING SAFETY WITH QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\n\\nAll BMW Group vehicles are subject to stringent\\nsafety tests during development and production, some of\\nwhich are even stricter than those prescribed by law. The\\nBMW Group’s quality management does not end at the\\nfactory gate, but also extends to vehicles that customers\\nare already using. If any deviations from the Group’s\\nstrict quality standards are observed in their markets, it\\nsystematically follows up on these indications. If necessary, the Group informs the relevant authorities without\\ndelay and initiates any measures that may be required.\\nThe BMW Group take voluntary technical action even\\nif there is no immediate danger. Any vehicles potentially\\naffected are checked, and if a fault is detected the corresponding components are replaced. If there is a safety\\nrisk of any kind, the BMW Group implements technical\\nmeasures in collaboration with the relevant authorities.\\nFor this reason, the Group has established appropriate\\ncommittees, processes and organisations that are managed by the Product Support, Technical Actions and\\nWarranty Costs department. GRI 416-1\\n\\nCONTINUOUS FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF SAFETY\\nSYSTEMS\\n\\nBy systematically developing and improving its safety\\nsystems, the BMW Group is helping to reduce the risk of\\naccidents and injuries for all road users. An important indicator of this risk is the European New Car Assessment\\nProgramme (Euro NCAP), a scheme for assessing the\\nsafety of vehicles in the event of a crash. The results of\\nthe most recently assessed vehicles (four top Euro NCAP\\nratings for the BMW 1 Series, BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé,\\nBMW 3 Series and BMW Z4) once again demonstrate the\\nBMW Group’s premium standards in terms of vehicle\\nsafety.\\nIn the years to come, the BMW Group will continue\\nworking to additionally enhance the safety of its vehicles.\\nApart from constantly optimising the passive safety of\\neach individual vehicle, the Group is also focusing on\\nimproving road safety standards by means of connected\\nand automated driving. This applies, for example, to the\\nBMW iX *, which was unveiled during the year under\\nreport and will go into series production in 2021. With\\nits even more efficient sensor technology, the vehicle will\\nbe equipped with new and improved automated driving\\nand parking functions and set new standards for the\\nBMW Group.\\n\\n* See\\n\\nFuel Consumption and CO2 Emissions Information.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nProducts and Services\\n\\nCARBON EMISSIONS\\nAND POLLUTANTS\\n\\nThe fight against climate change is crucial for the\\nfuture of our society – and thus also for that of the\\nBMW Group. For this reason, it is placing sustainability in the centre of its corporate strategy. In future,\\nthe BMW Group intends to be even more systematic in\\nexamining not only the economic, but also the ecological\\nand social impact of its corporate decisions. The Group\\nhas therefore also committed to the requirements of the\\nParis Climate Agreement that are relevant to it and set\\nitself the target of establishing a climate-neutral business\\nmodel across its entire value chain by the year 2050.\\nIn 2020, the BMW Group undercut the EU’s manufacturer-specific fleet carbon emissions limit of 104 g / km\\nby achieving a figure of 99 g / km according to internal\\ncalculations. At the same time, it also accomplished\\nthe goal it set itself in 2012 of halving the carbon emissions generated by its European new vehicle fleet by 2020\\ncompared with 1995. Furthermore, the BMW Group\\nwill continue to work successfully on constantly reducing\\nits carbon emissions going forward. The BMW Group\\naims to provide its customers with the best offers worldwide, also in terms of sustainability. For this reason, the\\nBMW Group’s drivetrain technology is based on two\\nfactors – highly efficient combustion engines and electric\\nmobility.\\n\\n76\\n\\nNEW TARGETS FOR DECARBONISATION BY 2030\\n\\nThe BMW Group is committed to achieving longterm carbon neutrality by 2050. Guided by this principle,\\nit is taking extensive measures to substantially reduce\\nthe carbon and other pollutant emissions generated by\\nits vehicles, as it has done in the past. In the year under\\nreport, the BMW Group therefore set itself specific new\\ntargets derived from the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI) in order to further cut its carbon emissions\\nbelow the level already achieved and is taking a holistic\\napproach to accomplishing this aim. In this context, the\\nGroup intends to achieve a mitigation corridor across all\\nthe activities for which it is responsible that corresponds\\nto the defined target set out in the 2015 Paris Climate\\nAgreement, i. e. to limit global warming to between 1.5\\nand 1.75 degrees Celsius. Within the value chain, this\\nincludes all three scopes defined under the umbrella of\\nthe Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI). By 2030, the\\nBMW Group therefore intends to reduce the average carbon emissions generated by its new car fleet in the use\\nphase by 40 % compared to 2019 (Scope 3 downstream).\\nFurthermore, the BMW Group is scrutinising its entire\\nvalue chain and striving to significantly reduce carbon\\nemissions from the supply chain (Scope 3 upstream),\\nits production processes (Scope 1 and 2) and the entire\\nuse phase. These targets have been notified to the SBTI\\nand validated.\\n\\nmore than\\n\\n– 40 %\\ndrop in carbon emissions\\ngenerated by the new car fleet\\nin the use phase by 2030\\n\\nRecording carbon emissions\\nfrom Scope 1 to Scope 3\\nThe carbon emissions generated by a given company are recorded in various categories. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a partnership between the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the\\nWorld Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD),\\ndistinguishes between Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions,\\nbased on their various sources.\\nWhereas Scope 1 emissions are generated within a company\\nthrough the combustion of fossil fuels, Scope 2 refers to the indirect emissions caused by the consumption of electricity and heat\\nfrom externally generated sources of energy. Scope 3 emissions\\nare generated in the upstream and downstream stages of the value chain, both in the supply chain (upstream) and in the subsequent use of products and services (downstream).\\n\\nFLEET CARBON EMISSIONS FURTHER REDUCED\\n\\nThe development of sustainable products and services has long been an integral part of the BMW Group’s\\nbusiness model. The early fleet-wide use of Efficient Dynamics technologies (since 2007) and the electrification\\nof vehicles (since 2013) are continuously reducing carbon\\nemissions in the long term. These twin factors form the\\nbasis for complying with and even undercutting legally\\nprescribed carbon emissions and fuel consumption limits.\\n\\n\\x0cCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nProducts and Services\\n\\nTaking all regulatory requirements ¹ into account, the\\naverage carbon emissions generated by the BMW Group’s\\nnew car fleet within the EU (including Norway and\\nIceland) according to the NEDC ² in the year under report\\namounted to 99 g CO₂ / km ³.

GRI 302-5, 305-5\\n\\nRANGE OF ELECTRIFIED VEHICLES FURTHER EXPANDED\\n\\nThe BMW Group sees wide-ranging opportunities\\nto further reduce fuel consumption and pollutant emissions in the electrification of power trains. This point\\nis particularly relevant against the backdrop of global\\ndecarbonisation targets, for example in the EU, China or\\nthe USA (particularly California), and the sustainability\\ntargets the BMW Group has set itself for 2030. For this\\nreason, the BMW Group again expanded its range of\\nelectrified vehicles during the 2020 reporting year. By\\n2030, the Group plans to have delivered at least seven million electrified vehicles to its customers. Electric Mobility\\n\\n7 million\\nelectrified vehicles delivered\\nby 2030\\n\\n78\\n\\nCONVENTIONAL DRIVETRAINS MORE EFFICIENT AND\\nWITH LOWER EMISSIONS\\n\\nThe BMW Group continues to work intensively\\non reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions\\nin its conventionally powered vehicles. Since 2007,\\nthe BMW Group has been implementing its Efficient\\nDynamics package of technological measures throughout the fleet, comprising various coordinated measures\\nto reduce fuel consumption. In this context, the Group\\ncontinued to optimise the efficiency of its combustion\\nengines throughout the year under report by deploying\\nrecuperation systems and continuous emissions reduction measures. Recuperation systems utilise the energy\\nrecovered from the braking process to supply the vehicle’s electrical system and generate additional power for\\nthe drivetrain. For this reason they are often referred to\\nas mild hybrid vehicles. Electrified Vehicles\\nSince the early 1990s, the BMW Group has managed\\nto significantly reduce the pollutant emissions generated\\nby its vehicles by deploying new technologies and making improvements to existing ones. In Europe alone, it\\nhas reduced the relevant exhaust emissions of the new\\nvehicle fleets for diesel passenger cars in accordance with\\nthe threshold values of the standards Euro 1 to Euro 6\\nfrom 1992 to 2019 by well over 90 % compared to the level\\nrecorded prior to the introduction of the Euro emissions\\nstandards. GRI 305-7 The introduction of new models\\nwith even lower-emissions drivetrain technologies has\\nmade a significant contribution to this result. In the\\nyear under report, the BMW Group also converted all\\nits remaining models to the Euro 6d emissions standard.\\n\\nThe BMW Group expects modern, highly efficient\\ndiesel engines to continue playing an important role. As\\npart of its Efficient Dynamics approach, the BMW Group\\nwill therefore continue to work on reducing the consumption of conventional drivetrain systems and boosting\\ntheir efficiency in the foreseeable future. It intends to\\ncontinue along this route, taking innovative approaches\\nto the combustion engine, aerodynamics and lightweight\\ndesign. The use of 48-volt technology is another key\\ncomponent in the BMW Group’s efforts to reduce its\\ncarbon emissions.\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) can also contribute to cutting carbon emissions and vehicle fuel consumption. The\\nBMW Group is conducting research into how AI could\\nmake energy management in vehicles adaptive, enabling\\nenergy consumption to be modified to suit the needs of\\nthe driver and further improve energy efficiency.\\nNitrogen oxide levels are a crucial factor for the air\\nquality in towns and cities. With this point in mind, since\\nmid-2018 the BMW Group has installed a highly effective\\ncombination of an NOx storage catalytic converter (NSC)\\nand an SCR system (SCR: selective catalytic reduction)\\nwith urea injection technology (AdBlue) in all BMW\\ndiesel models as well as in the larger MINI diesels. As\\npart of its continuous further development strategy, the\\nBMW Group has additionally improved the efficiency of\\nits exhaust gas after-treatment technology by utilising\\nan oxidation catalytic converter in conjunction with two\\nSCR catalytic converters. In 2020, this new technique\\nwas launched and rolled out across the Group’s product\\nportfolio together with the revised generation of its diesel\\nengines.\\n1\\n2\\n\\nBasis: USC (United States Combined).\\nBasis: NEDC (New European Driving Cycle).\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nProducts and Services\\n\\nWith the aim of spreading these innovations\\nfor improving air quality as swiftly as possible, the\\nBMW Group offered a scrappage bonus in Germany in\\n2020. The move was intended to rejuvenate the passenger\\ncar fleet and thus contribute quickly and effectively to\\nreducing nitrogen oxide emissions. In 2019 and 2020,\\nthere were already first signs of a noticeable reduction\\nin NOx pollution in German cities, partially due to the\\nprogressive renewal of the fleets of all automotive manufacturers. GRI 416-2\\n\\n79\\n\\nmatters agreed therein are valid for every state in the\\nUSA – one of the BMW Group’s largest sales markets.\\nThe commitments made enhance the Group’s long-term\\nplanning security in the face of political change and are\\nin line with increasingly stringent legislation worldwide\\ndesigned to reduce vehicle emissions. In view of the\\ngrowing popularity of electric mobility, for example,\\nthe BMW Group sees the rapid expansion and technical\\nharmonisation of charging infrastructure as an urgent\\nrequirement. In the USA and Europe in particular, the\\nslow pace of infrastructural expansion is still holding\\nback the spread of electric mobility.\\n\\nSUCCESSFUL REDUCTION SURPASSES LEGAL\\nREQUIREMENTS\\nMANAGEMENT OVER THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE\\nThe BMW Group has the clear ambition to meet statutory carbon emissions requirements. Within the EU, the\\nGroup succeeded in improving on fleet carbon targets\\nduring the year under report. With respect to fleet carbon limits in other regulated markets, the BMW Group is\\nalso explicitly aiming to comply with the limits and keep\\nits emissions as far below them as possible, which it again\\nsucceeded in doing in the year under report.\\nThe BMW Group supports the development of harmonised national regulations, also on an international\\nbasis to the extent possible. Comparable regulations in\\nmajor markets create reliable, predictable framework\\nconditions that make a key contribution to combating\\nclimate change and improving air quality. In view of\\nits commitment to complying with the climate goals\\nenshrined in the Paris Agreement, during the year\\nunder report the BMW Group entered into a voluntary\\nagreement with the US State of California to reduce fleet\\nemissions over and above national requirements. The\\n\\nIn order to meet market-specific fleet requirements\\nand its own even more ambitious decarbonisation targets, the BMW Group is taking an holistic approach to\\nreducing emissions throughout the entire life cycle of its\\nvehicles. This approach is particularly relevant, as – despite the expansion of electric mobility having an overall\\npositive impact on carbon emissions in the use phase –\\nemissions levels in the supply chain are increasing due to\\nthe use of more carbon-intensive components, especially\\nthose installed in high-voltage battery systems. For this\\nreason, right from the product development stage of new\\nvehicle projects, the BMW Group has defined specific\\ntargets for reducing carbon emissions across the entire\\nlife cycle. The strategy applies equally to the vehicle development, the supply chain, production, the use phase,\\nand finally recycling at the end-of-life phase.\\n\\nWith this approach of taking the entire vehicle life\\ncycle into account, the BMW Group intends to realise its\\nambition of achieving substantial improvement from one\\nvehicle generation to the next. The Group implements its\\ntargets and assesses its progress during the development\\nprocess based on a carbon footprint in accordance with\\nthe ISO 14040 / 44 standard.

The\\nfigure of 25 electrified models previous targeted to be on\\nthe roads by 2025 has now been brought forward to 2023.\\n\\nTo further increase the range of its electrified vehicles,\\nthe BMW Group is improving both the energy density\\nand the efficiency of its battery cells. For example, the\\nhigh-voltage battery in the BMW iX3 ¹ has a 20 % higher\\nenergy density and the power density of the electric\\nmotor has also been increased by 30 %.\\n\\n1\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\nSee\\nFuel Consumption and CO2 Emissions Information.\\nRetail vehicle delivery data presented for 2020 is not directly comparable to such data presented for previous\\nyears.

The BMW Group also intends to\\noffer its high-volume models as purely battery-powered\\nversions. From today’s perspective, the European Union’s\\ntarget of attaining climate neutrality by 2050, the interim\\ntargets discussed in the context of the Green Deal and\\nthe similarly ambitious climate policy targets of other\\ncountries can only be achieved with a variety of parallel\\ntechnologies if customers are to continue being offered\\na range of mobility options that meet their specific and\\ndiffering needs going forward. Even today, from a global\\nviewpoint there are driving profiles that cannot yet\\nbe covered by an all-electric vehicle due to physical or\\ntechnical restrictions or insufficient access to a viable\\ncharging infrastructure.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nProducts and Services\\n\\nPHEVs and highly efficient internal combustion\\nengines are therefore a more likely choice in this environment. For these reasons, the BMW X3 * is the first\\nmodel series to be available in two variants, firstly with\\na combustion engine and secondly as a plug-in hybrid\\nversion, thanks to the BMW Group’s scalable, modular\\nconstruction system. The BMW iX3 * is also available with\\nits all-electric drivetrain.\\nQuite apart from battery-powered electric drivetrain\\nsystems, the BMW Group also continues to see the potential of fuel cells, a technology embedded in the hydrogen\\nstrategy of various countries. The Group is planning to\\nproduce a small series of the BMW i Hydrogen NEXT\\nfrom 2022. Moreover, as an associated partner of H2\\nMobility Deutschland GmbH, the BMW Group is interested in establishing the infrastructure required for\\nhydrogen-powered vehicles.\\n\\nACHIEVING SUSTAINABILITY OVER THE ENTIRE\\nLIFE CYCLE\\n\\nThe BMW Group considers both decarbonisation\\ntargets and market-specific fleet requirements right from\\nthe product development stage. In doing so, it defines\\nspecific targets that ensure well-balanced optimisation\\nover the entire life cycle.\\nWith its project i, the BMW Group was among the\\nfirst manufacturers to pursue the aim of reducing carbon\\n\\n82\\n\\nand other pollutant emissions as well as the use of critical\\nmaterials over the entire life cycle of its vehicles right\\nfrom the very beginning. With the fifth generation of\\nBMW eDrive, the Group reached an important milestone\\nduring the year under report. A special feature of the\\nelectric motor, which is being installed in the BMW iX3 *\\nfor the first time (eDrive Gen5), has been designed so\\nthat it no longer requires the use of rare earth elements.\\nFor the fifth generation of its high-voltage storage system,\\nthe BMW Group obtains any critical raw materials it requires from sources outside the known conflict regions.\\nCobalt that is bought in directly by BMW Group and\\nmade available to suppliers is sourced from Morocco and\\nAustralia. The lithium used is also from Australia, where\\nit is extracted by means of the so-called hard rock mining\\nprocess. In addition, the BMW Group has successfully\\nreduced the amount of cobalt required per kWh by twothirds through the further chemical development of its\\nbattery cells. Purchasing and Supplier Network\\nThe use of renewable energy in production processes – for example in the manufacture of energy-intensive\\nmaterials such as carbon fibre reinforced plastic – or the\\nchoice of green electricity in the use phase – also help\\nreduce the carbon footprint of the BMW Group’s vehicles.\\nFurther information on how efficiently and therefore economically and sparingly the BMW Group uses resources\\nin its production processes is provided in the section\\nResource Consumption and Resource Efficiency.\\n\\nThe BMW Group has entered into a contractual agreement with its battery cell manufacturers to ensure that\\nthey only use green electricity when producing the fifth\\n\\ngeneration of battery cells. In a joint technology consortium with battery manufacturer Northvolt, the Group\\nalso plans to configure the value chain for battery cells\\nin Europe with sustainability as its top priority.\\nOther approaches to handling resources in a responsible, sustainable manner include the reuse of batteries,\\nsuch as in stationary storage systems with the aim of\\nimproving the use of renewable energy and promoting\\nrecycling. In collaboration with the recycling specialist\\nDuesenfeld, for example, the BMW Group has developed\\nthe prototype of a process that enables 96 % of the material from battery cells to be recovered for recycling. Furthermore, the option exists for all customers whose vehicle contains a high-voltage battery for the BMW Group\\nto take the battery back free of charge. This also applies\\nto regions where there is no legal obligation to do so.\\nThe BMW Group manages the implementation of its\\ntargets and assesses progress in vehicle development via\\nits Life Cycle Assessment in accordance with the ISO\\n14040 / 44 standard. The Group utilises these assessments\\nto record the environmental impacts occurring over the\\nlife cycle of a vehicle right from the development stage\\nand make comparisons with predecessor models. However, the BMW Group’s approach goes one step further: it\\nbreaks down the targets by product and then implements\\nthe appropriate measures. These include, for example,\\nthe use of green electricity for energy-intensive processes\\nin the supply chain or in production as well as the use of\\nrecycled materials such as aluminium or plastics instead\\nof deploying primary resources.\\n\\n* See\\n\\nFuel Consumption and CO2 Emissions Information.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nProducts and Services\\n\\nThe BMW Group aims to ensure that electric and\\nelectrified vehicles make an effective contribution to\\nclimate protection not only in the use phase, but also in\\ntheir overall footprint, including the supply chain. As\\nan example, the environmental report of the BMW iX3 *\\nindicates that the greenhouse gas potential values of an\\nall-electric vehicle are around 30 % lower than those of\\na conventional reference vehicle with a diesel drivetrain\\nwhen the calculation is based on standard consumption\\nand the European electricity mix. Furthermore, when\\nthe electricity used for charging is generated from renewable energy sources, the emissions values are around\\n60 % lower.\\n\\nCompetence centre for battery cells\\nIn 2019, the BMW Group began pooling its wealth of experience and comprehensive knowledge of battery cell technology\\nin a new competence centre based in Munich. With this strategy,\\nthe Group is pursuing the twin aims of further improving its battery cell technology and fully penetrating production processes.\\nBased on the battery technology currently in use, the BMW Group\\nintends to substantially increase the potential range of its electrified vehicles by 2030 by continuing to develop its battery cells,\\nmodules and systems. Looking to the future, the focus will be\\neven more on cutting battery system costs in order to make electric mobility more profitable.\\nThe competence centre replicates the entire value chain of battery cell technology, from research and development to the structure and the design of the battery cell to the production of the first\\nprototypes. It takes the complete life cycle of a battery cell into account, from purchasing the raw materials to recycling. Particularly\\nin view of the high-voltage batteries needed to power electrified vehicles, which can entail the use of critical raw materials, the circular economy has a decisive role to play. Production, Purchasing\\nand Supplier Network\\n\\n83\\n\\nEXPANDING THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND\\nENABLING FASTER CHARGING\\n\\nA comprehensive charging infrastructure is a prerequisite for the rapid, widespread deployment of electric\\nmobility. In order to promote this project, between 2015\\nand 2020 the BMW Group committed itself to improving\\nthe charging infrastructure in a total of over 50 projects\\nand has initiated the installation of some 15,000 operational charging points. The BMW Group plans to install a\\ntotal of 4,100 charging points at BMW Group properties\\nin Germany by the end of 2021. Half of these charging\\npoints will be made accessible for public use. Together\\nwith other car manufacturers, charging station providers,\\ncharging service providers and energy suppliers, the\\nBMW Group is working on simplifying not only access\\nto charging stations, but also the charging process itself.\\nAt European level, in close collaboration with the\\nIONITY joint venture, the BMW Group is in the process\\nof building a high-performance fast-charging network comprising some 400 charging stations along major transport\\nroutes by 2021. Fast-charging stations make charging up to\\nseven times faster than standard 50 kW stations. Originally\\nplanned for completion by 2020, due to the coronavirus\\npandemic and the lack of approvals, the BMW Group and\\nits partners were compelled to postpone the construction of\\ncertain stations until 2021. To date, 325 of the 400 planned\\nIONITY fast-charging stations have been installed and a\\nfurther 44 are currently under construction. At powerful\\nand increasingly widespread DC fast-charging points\\nwith outputs of at least 150 kW, the BMW iX3 * can be\\ncharged to achieve a range of over 100 km (WLTP) in\\naround ten minutes.\\n\\nThe BMW Group intends to offer electric mobility to\\nboth private customers and companies operating entire\\nfleets and is additionally expanding the BMW Charging\\nproduct and service portfolio for trendsetting charging\\nsolutions at home, on the road and at the workplace.\\nCharging infrastructure for both private and commercial\\npurposes is a key prerequisite for the further expansion\\nof electric mobility. The BMW Group welcomes the support provided by government premiums, as charging\\noptions both at home and at the workplace make a key\\ncontribution to the overall infrastructure from the point\\nof view of customers.\\n\\nGREEN ELECTRICITY FOR E-MOBILITY\\n\\nDuring the year under report, the BMW Group\\ncontinued to pursue and expand its approaches to the\\nholistic ecological optimisation of electric mobility both\\nat home and on the road. In addition to BMW Charging\\nand MINI Charging, the Group already offers electricity\\nfrom renewable sources as well as attractive solar power\\npackages for homes in both Germany and Austria. As\\npart of its strategic investment in the IONITY joint venture, the BMW Group is preparing to broaden its range\\nof services to enter other markets as well as the field of\\npublic charging.\\n\\n* See\\n\\nFuel Consumption and CO2 Emissions Information.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nProducts and Services\\n\\nIMPROVING POLITICAL CONDITIONS\\n\\nIn the BMW Group’s view, there is still a need for\\npolitical support for electric mobility in many countries\\nand cities. In the EU, for example, market research points\\nto the close correlation between the density of charging\\ninfrastructure and the sale of electrified vehicles. This\\ncorrelation applies not only at member state level, but\\nalso in a regional comparison. The BMW Group is\\ntherefore seeking dialogue with policymakers to call for\\nmeasures to be taken to improve consistency on both\\nthe supply and the demand sides. In concrete terms,\\nthe aim is to improve framework conditions with the\\naim of stimulating demand for electrified vehicles not\\nonly nationally, but also at local level. The focus here is\\non increasing the number of public charging points and\\noffering usage incentives in everyday life, such as parking spaces reserved for electric vehicles or discounts on\\nparking fees. In Germany, for example, only a few cities\\nhave so far taken advantage of the funding opportunities\\noffered by the Electric Mobility Act.\\nTo advocate for improved conditions, the BMW Group\\nis involved, for example, in the National Platform for the\\nFuture of Mobility (NPM), in the European initiative EIT\\nUrban Mobility and within the framework of the World\\nEconomic Forum. Furthermore, the BMW Group is in\\ndialogue with think tanks such as Agora Verkehrswende\\nand is a member of the International Consultative Committee of China EV 100 as well as at VELOZ, a non-profit\\norganisation dedicated to promoting electric mobility in\\nthe US state of California.\\n\\n84\\n\\nMOBILITY PATTERNS\\n\\nThe BMW Group wants to make mobility more sustainable and more convenient to use. In recent years,\\nnumerous urban mobility offers have been developed\\nand introduced in cooperation with selected towns and\\ncities. The BMW Group therefore sees its 2020 target\\nof providing sustainable support for changing mobility\\nbehaviour by offering integrated mobility services in\\nselected metropolitan regions as having been met.\\nMoreover, the Group continues to work together with\\nits subsidiaries and in dialogue with the respective cities\\nto find solutions to the increasing density of road traffic\\nand the corresponding rise in noise levels, air pollution\\nand land use. The BMW Group is also meeting these\\nchallenges by developing connected vehicles. In view of\\nthe growing trend towards vehicle electrification, the\\nGroup is therefore making a significant contribution in\\nparticular to providing eco-friendlier modes of transport\\nas well as promoting the better use of space in urban\\nareas.\\n\\nMAKING URBAN MOBILITY SUSTAINABLE WITH\\nSERVICES\\n\\nThe BMW Group is currently working together with\\nthree German cities to improve the traffic situation\\nand explore new mobility solutions. The New Mobility\\nBerlin project aims to improve the quality of life within\\nthe city. For this reason, the BMW Group is developing tailor-made multimodal solutions, i. e. approaches\\nthat incorporate the entire range of transport modes.\\nIn selected districts of the city, via its subsidiaries, the\\nBMW Group offers shared fleets of rental cars and\\ne-scooters as an alternative to privately used vehicles.\\nThe strategy is intended to encourage better use of the\\nroad space occupied by rarely used private vehicles for\\nother purposes going forward.\\nAt the same time, the BMW Group has reached\\nagreements with the cities of Munich and Hamburg,\\nwhere it has carried out the first pilot projects for making\\ncity centres more pleasant to live in. Specific examples of\\nthe development of new, sustainable mobility options include the City2Share research project, which focuses on\\nmeasures to reduce traffic in project districts in Munich\\nand Hamburg, and the “umparken Schwabing-West” project, in which the BMW Group is working to transform\\npublic space and enable it to be used more appropriately\\nby offering mobility packages for local residents.\\nThe BMW Group is also involved in various urban\\nplatforms via which municipalities exchange information\\nand collaborate on projects, including the Urban Mobility\\nPlatform in Germany and the international\\nEIT Urban\\nMobility Platform of the European Institute of Innovation and\\nTechnology.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nProducts and Services\\n\\nVia its subsidiaries, the BMW Group promotes\\ninnovative service offerings in the fields of car sharing,\\ndriving services, parking and vehicle charging as well as\\nmultimodal transport. In 2019, the BMW Group therefore merged its own mobility services in a joint venture\\nwith those of Daimler Mobility Services GmbH to create\\nthe YOUR NOW service. The common goal of the two\\ncompanies is to expand the use of on-demand mobility\\nand offer new solutions for cities and municipalities\\nlooking to make road use more efficient and sustainable. In this context, the market development and the\\npolitical-regulatory framework conditions in the cities are\\ncontinuously being examined and the range of services\\nfurther developed in collaboration with strategic partners.\\nThe BMW Group has expanded its car-sharing\\nservice offering (SHARE NOW) to include a long-term\\nrental of up to 30 days. It also continued to develop\\nFREE NOW into a multimodal mobility platform by\\nadding e-bikes and e-scooters. In 2020, FREE NOW had\\n46 million registered customers and offers ride services\\nin 17 countries and 153 cities. In the year under report,\\naround 2.9 million customers used the SHARE NOW\\ncar-sharing services, which are available in 16 cities and\\neight countries. The car-sharing fleet currently comprises around 9,500 vehicles, almost one-quarter of which\\nare electrically powered. In 2020, the number of trips\\ndecreased due to the coronavirus pandemic.\\nThe CHARGE NOW vehicle charging service currently provides access to around 246,000 public charging\\npoints operated by various providers in 32 countries. In\\naddition to its CHARGE NOW services, the BMW Group\\nis working with partners in other markets to provide customers with broad access to charging points. The PARK\\nNOW digital parking service enabled around 45 million\\n\\n85\\n\\ncustomers in around 1,200 cities to pay more quickly and\\neasily for parking spaces on a contactless basis. However,\\nPARK NOW’s business performance was also impacted\\nby the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.\\nThe BMW Group and its subsidiaries are working\\ncontinuously on intelligently interconnecting vehicles,\\ninfrastructure and mobility services. The aim here is to\\nmake better use of the limited parking space available\\nand reduce traffic congestion. The BMW Group is fully\\ncommitted to complying with statutory limits for air\\nquality, noise levels and carbon emissions as well as to\\nrestoring the quality of life for the residents of urban areas. For these reasons, the BMW Group intends to further\\nintensify its dialogue with towns and cities and make an\\nactive contribution to the discussion on more sustainable\\nmobility options as well as tailored traffic management\\nmeasures. The Group also intends to transfer the results\\nachieved in individual cities to other areas and adapt\\nthem on an international basis.\\n\\nfurther with the development of the BMW iX*. It will be\\nthe first BMW Group vehicle to offer both automated\\ndriving and parking functions via a new modular technology system. The BMW Group sees considerable potential in automated driving and will continue to develop\\nthis field intensively over the next few years.\\n\\nEmployee mobility\\nAs the largest single employer in the Munich metropolitan region,\\nthe BMW Group has a special role to play in its hometown location\\nand the surrounding urban areas by actively helping to reduce environmental pollution. The Group is planning to have one of the\\nlargest company charging networks in place by mid-2021, thereby helping to increase the popularity of electric mobility and reduce carbon dioxide as well as other pollutant emissions.\\nThe BMW Group provides incentives for its employees to use\\npublic transport, including benefits such as a discounted monthly ticket within the Munich city area. Around 14,000 employees\\nhave chosen this option. The Group also operates a long-established shuttle bus service between its locations. It also provides\\nits staff with rental bicycles and scooters for commuting. Last but\\nnot least, as a good example, with its BMW LeaseRad offer, the\\nGroup is actively supporting the growing number of employees\\nwho choose to ride to work by bicycle and also encourages travel-\\n\\nFURTHER DEVELOPING AUTOMATED DRIVING\\n\\nling by bicycle and scooter in general.\\n\\nAutomated functions and digitally connected vehicles\\ncan help reduce traffic congestion, minimise the risk of\\naccidents and cut emissions levels.

Its own plants and locations\\nhave a direct influence on both carbon emissions levels\\nand resource consumption. The BMW Group has been\\ncommitted to resource-efficient production at its plants\\nfor many years. This includes checking and monitoring\\nthe consumption of resources across the BMW Group’s\\nproduction network. The principle of continuous improvement applies throughout the BMW Group. It invests in efficient technologies and also continually seeks\\nto optimise its existing processes and procedures. This\\nprinciple has been highly successful, as the Group clearly\\nsurpassed its target of reducing resource consumption\\nper vehicle produced by an average of 45 % by 2020 compared to 2006 , achieving an overall reduction of 56.7 %.\\nApart from continuously reducing energy consumption\\nin general, the BMW Group is now focusing on converting its electricity supply to renewable energy sources.\\nAny remaining production-related emissions that cannot\\nyet be avoided will be offset from 2021 onwards.\\n\\nNEW PRODUCTION TARGETS UP TO 2030\\n\\nThe biggest lever for reducing the BMW Group’s\\nScope 1 and Scope 2 emissions is at its production\\nlocations, which account for around 90 % of these emissions. The BMW Group has had considerable success\\nin this area and repeatedly set new standards in terms\\nof sustainable production methods. Between 2006 and\\n2020, carbon emissions per vehicle produced fell by\\naround 78 % by continually improving energy efficiency,\\ngenerating renewable electricity in-house and entering\\ninto direct supply contracts for green power (including\\nguarantees of origin). Nevertheless, the BMW Group\\nhas already set itself the next target: compared to 2019,\\nthese emissions levels are to be reduced by a further\\n80 % per vehicle by 2030. As from 2021, the Group will\\nmake the remaining carbon emissions from Scope 1 and\\nScope 2 completely carbon-neutral by using voluntary\\noffset certificates.\\n\\nCarbon emissions per vehicle produced fell by\\naround 23 % to 0.23 t compared with the previous year.\\nThe reduction is a result of completely switching the\\nBMW Group’s production network to green electricity\\ngenerated from renewable sources. The BMW Group also\\nmanaged to reduce the absolute level of carbon emissions\\ngenerated by the production network to 486,630 t (2019:\\n697,025 t).

For example, if\\nelectric mobility is not only to be produced using primary materials in the long term, the underlying flows\\nof resources need to undergo a sustainable transformation. The BMW Group intends to create high-quality\\nsecondary raw materials by promoting a greater degree\\nof transparency in the recycling chain and tracking the\\nactual further use of raw materials within the cycle. The\\nGroup wants to provide effective impetus for a circular\\neconomy that is viable in the long term by emphasising\\nthe importance of recycling valuable resources. At the\\nsame time, this strategy can significantly contribute to\\ncutting carbon emissions (Scope 3 upstream), as the use\\nof secondary raw materials can significantly reduce the\\nsize of the Group’s carbon footprint in its procurement\\nand production processes – even down to as little as\\none-sixth, depending on the material. For this reason,\\nthe BMW Group has defined the circular economy as\\na strategic focus for the coming years. This includes its\\nown internal initiatives as well as increasing its external\\ncommitment in dialogue with major stakeholders.\\nThe economical use of resources is already a key requirement in the design process and at the product development stage and guarantees that BMW Group products\\nare designed to ensure that as much raw material as\\npossible remains within the circular economy. In 2020,\\na total of 99.1 % of the waste generated in production\\nprocesses was either recycled or recovered. To the extent\\nviable, i. e. depending on the waste disposal market and\\ndistances to the supplier, the cycles of materials are physically closed so that the resulting recyclates can be reused.\\n\\n98\\n\\nEnd-of-life vehicles are therefore not considered as waste\\nto be disposed of, but as a source of secondary raw materials. For this reason, the BMW Group promotes the\\nreturn of end-of-life vehicles, components and materials\\nto the raw materials cycle. Together with its sales organisations in each country, the Group has already organised\\nthe taking back of end-of-life vehicles in 30 countries and\\noffers environmentally friendly recycling services at more\\nthan 2,800 take-back centres. All vehicles brought onto\\nthe market since 2008 comply with global requirements\\nfor the recycling of end-of-life vehicles, components and\\nmaterials. Already today, vehicles are required to be 95 %\\nrecyclable. GRI 301-3\\nBy 2030, the BMW Group intends to further increase\\nthe percentage of recycled secondary raw materials in\\nits vehicles while systematically developing the recycling process at the same time. During the year under\\nreport, around 25 % of the steel and up to 20 % of the\\nthermoplastics the Group used for vehicle manufacturing\\nwere derived from secondary sources. Up to 50 % of the\\naluminium the BMW Group uses to make its aluminium\\ncastings comes from secondary sources. Average Distribution of Materials in BMW Group Vehicles\\n\\nGRI 301-2\\n\\nIn its efforts to minimise waste, the BMW Group has\\ndeveloped recycling and reprocessing concepts that are\\nadapted to the waste flows in its various plants, to regional legal requirements and to existing local waste disposal\\nstructures. Moreover, the Group intends to increase its\\nlevel of expertise in the development and production of\\nbattery cells Electric Mobility and create greater transparency regarding the whereabouts and recycling of end-oflife vehicles and their resources. Input / Output Assessment\\n\\nThrough its own venture capital fund BMW i Ventures, the BMW Group has invested in key technologies\\nthat can make a decisive contribution towards achieving\\nits long-term vision of carbon neutrality. In 2020, for example, BMW i Ventures invested in PureCycle, the first\\ncompany in the world that can recycle polypropylene\\n(an essential vehicle component) into a colourless and\\nodourless native state. The BMW Group also invested\\nin Prometheus Fuels, which has developed a technology\\nthat enables carbon-neutral synthetic fuels to be produced using green energy.\\n\\nLogistics: freight carriers and carbon emissions\\nIn close cooperation with freight carriers, infrastructure operators and commercial vehicle manufacturers, the BMW Group\\nis developing ecologically sustainable logistics concepts. The\\nGreen Logistics strategy pursues the logistical aim of achieving climate-neutral transportation, thereby contributing to the\\nGroup’s target of reducing carbon emissions in the supply chain\\nby 20 % per vehicle by 2030 (base year 2019).\\nThe carbon footprint and the use of carbon-efficient energy and\\nmodes of transport is a decisive criterion for the BMW Group\\nwhen selecting freight carriers. Currently, more than half of the\\nvehicles the Group produces are transported from manufacturing plants by rail. When supplying vehicles to the Chinese market, the BMW Group is further reducing its carbon footprint by\\nusing the railway lines along the Silk Road more intensively. In order to reduce carbon emissions, some of the spare parts sent to\\nChina by airfreight are being increasingly dispatched by rail. For\\nother overseas markets, the option to switch to intermodal air-sea\\ntransport has been tested.\\nThe BMW Group is increasingly working on the further development and piloting as well as the use of innovative technologies and already deploys battery- and gas-driven trucks to supply production facilities. In 2020, the BMW Group used the sea\\nroute from Belgium to Spain for vehicle production purposes. The\\nuse of biofuel from waste cooking oil led to a reduction in carbon\\nemissions of 1,100 t.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nProduction, Purchasing and Supplier Network\\n\\nRENEWABLE ENERGY\\n\\nAll BMW Group locations worldwide as well as\\nthe BMW Brilliance Automotive (BBA) joint venture\\npurchase 100 % green electricity, i. e. energy generated\\nfrom renewable sources ¹.

The strategy includes\\nthe use of process heat in paint shops and data analysis\\nto reduce the power consumption of its machinery to\\na minimum. Moreover, the BMW Group is further expanding its own renewable power generation capacities\\nat its various locations and increasing its energy storage\\ncapability.

With the\\ngrowing demand for electrified vehicles, the need for the\\nrespective components and parts in production is also increasing. For battery cells in particular, the BMW Group\\nis taking a variety of measures to accommodate this\\ngrowth. For example, it will purchase the battery cells\\nfor its entire fifth generation from four different suppliers, thus making itself less dependent on individual\\nmanufacturers. Flexibility in terms of volume is both a\\npremise and a decisive criterion for selecting battery cell\\nsuppliers.\\n\\n100\\n\\nThe Purchasing and Supplier Network has been operating on a global basis for many years and adheres to\\nthe principle of procuring parts and components locally.\\nThe BMW Group has efficient teams on the ground in all\\nof its key purchasing markets.

The Group already addressed this\\nissue in 2008, defining and setting out comprehensive\\nenvironmental and social standards for the awarding of\\ncontracts for the BMW i3. Since 2010, the BMW Group\\nhas required its partners and suppliers for BMW i models\\nto comply with human rights and extended environmental and social standards, including environmental\\nprotection management systems. Since 2014, these specifications have been mandatory for suppliers of all vehicle\\nmodels. In 2019, this requirement was supplemented to\\ninclude occupational health and safety management\\nsystems wherever necessary.\\nFor many raw materials, the requirement to ensure\\nthat environmental standards and human rights have not\\nbeen violated poses a particular challenge, for instance\\nin the case of lithium and cobalt, both of which are key\\nraw materials for manufacturing battery cells.\\n\\nBy the year 2030, the BMW Group intends to have\\nover seven million electrified vehicles on the road. This\\nmeans that the average carbon emissions generated by\\nthe BMW Group’s supplier network (scope 3 upstream\\naccording to SBTI) will increase by more than one-third\\nper vehicle by 2030 if no countermeasures are taken.\\nApart from the growing percentage of electrified models\\nin the BMW Group’s product range, the reasons are, for\\nexample, the energy-intensive production of battery cells,\\nthe greater use of aluminium and increased localisation\\nin China, where the proportion of green electricity in\\nthe energy mix is still relatively low. Nevertheless, the\\nBMW Group has set itself the goal of not only halting this\\ntrend, but even reversing it and reducing carbon emissions per vehicle in the supply chain ¹ by at least 20 % ²\\n(base year 2019) by 2030. With this aim in mind, among\\nother measures, since 2020 it has established the carbon\\nfootprint as a criterion for awarding contracts within the\\nsupply chain.\\n\\nThe BMW Group is continuously expanding its sustainability activities across the supplier network. The focus is essentially on three key issues: 1. Decarbonisation,\\n2. Compliance with environmental and social standards,\\nparticularly human rights, and 3. The protection of natural resources.\\n\\nOne of the biggest levers for promoting decarbonisation in the supply chain is the use of green electricity.\\nFor this reason, the BMW Group has agreed with the\\nsuppliers of the current fifth generation of battery cells\\nto use only green electricity from renewable sources for\\nproduction purposes.\\n\\n1\\n2\\n\\nIncluding transport logistics.\\nValue rounded for simplification purposes. The target percentage validated in conjunction with SBTI is 22 %.\\n\\nMOTIVATING PARTNERS TO OPERATE SUSTAINABLY\\n\\nJust as the BMW Group continuously implements\\noptimisation and efficiency measures in its own production environment, it is also actively committed to\\npromoting decarbonisation measures within its supplier\\nnetwork. By participating in the CDP supply chain programme, the Group motivates its suppliers to operate\\nsustainably and, for example, utilise renewable energy\\nin their production activities. The core of the programme\\nconsists of annual reporting that takes a multitude of\\nclimate-related aspects into account, including specific\\nmeasures to reduce carbon emissions or increase the percentage of renewable energy deployed. The BMW Group\\nstrongly encourages its suppliers to set targets in line\\nwith the Paris Climate Agreement and thereby contribute to limiting global warming. The Group’s success is\\nreflected in the steadily growing number of suppliers\\nparticipating: 63 suppliers (2019: 40) reported at least\\none 2-degree-compliant target system, and 59 (2019: 54)\\nplan to publish one within the next two years.\\n\\nat least\\n\\n– 20 %\\nCO 2 emissions per vehicles\\nin the supply chain by 2030\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nProduction, Purchasing and Supplier Network\\n\\nIn 2020, a total of 218 suppliers to the BMW Group\\n(2019: 199) reported via the CDP Supply Chain programme, accounting for approximately 79 % of the\\nBMW Group’s production-related purchasing volume\\n(2019: 78 %). The participating suppliers reported carbon\\nreduction totalling some 22 million tonnes of emissions\\n(2019: 32 million tonnes), which are proportionately\\nattributable to the materials and goods supplied to the\\nBMW Group. Due to the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting decrease in production volumes, carbon emissions\\nwere generally lower in 2020. Accordingly, the reduction\\nin reported carbon emissions was also lower. GRI 308-1,\\n308-2, 414-1, 414-2\\n\\nThe BMW Group has integrated the assessments of\\nthe CDP Supply Chain Programme in its key purchasing\\nprocesses. The results are used in discussions with suppliers, in strategic management meetings and in overall\\nsupplier strategies to point out potential for improvement.\\nOn average, suppliers that have been reporting within the\\nCDP Supply Chain Programme for at least three years\\nhave improved. The BMW Group sees this fact as proof\\nthat the programme has become well established at the\\ncompanies participating for longer periods and that it\\nyields the intended results. In 2020, the Group also asked\\nmore than 1,000 additional suppliers who, as small and\\nmedium-sized companies, did not meet the criteria to be\\ninvited to the CDP Supply Chain Programme to complete\\na carbon-related questionnaire. The activity further covered approximately another 11 % (and therefore a total of\\n90 %) of the Group’s production-related purchasing volume. The results of the survey provided the BMW Group\\nwith additional insights that enabled it to further establish\\nthe carbon footprint assessment in the supply chain as an\\naward criterion in decision-making processes. This was\\nalready the case in 18 out of 31 tenders with the largest\\ncarbon footprint. GRI 308-1, 308-2, 414-1, 414-2\\n\\n102\\n\\nRESPECT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL\\nSTANDARDS AND HUMAN RIGHTS\\n\\nKEY ELEMENTS FOR SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS\\nPURCHASING\\n\\nIt is a major challenge to ensure compliance with\\nhuman rights as well as environmental, health and safety standards in the extraction of raw materials. For this\\nreason, BMW Group Purchasing goes beyond the mere\\ncontractual agreement of sustainability standards to a\\ndeeper point in the supply chain in order to conclude\\nrespective direct agreements at particularly critical points\\nin the supplier network and ensures compliance with\\nthem by conducting audits.\\n\\nDuring the year under report, the BMW Group\\nincluded key sustainability issues such as biodiversity,\\ndeforestation and animal welfare in its Supplier Sustainability Policy , which forms the basis for the Group’s terms\\nand conditions of purchase. Accordingly, BMW Group\\nsuppliers and all purchases are subject to the Group’s\\ncomprehensive sustainability requirements.\\n\\nThe BMW Group is also involved in various initiatives to standardise management approaches towards\\nimplementing human rights due diligence and applying\\nthem throughout the entire supplier network. In Germany, for example, these include the industry dialogue\\non respect for human rights along the global supply\\nand value chains of the German automotive industry,\\nin which the BMW Group is actively involved. It is also\\nactive internationally and involved in initiatives to standardise the mining of raw materials. By certifying mines\\nin accordance with the standards of the Initiative for\\nResponsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) or the\\nAluminium Stewardship\\nInitiative (ASI) , the BMW Group is promoting compliance\\nwith environmental and social standards right from the\\nraw material extraction stage with the aim of making a\\nsignificant contribution to improving compliance with\\nhuman rights throughout international supply chains.\\n\\nIn 2012, in its materials strategy the BMW Group\\nidentified particularly critical raw materials and other\\nmaterials from a sustainability perspective and initiated the cross-industry study Material Change Report (2018)\\non this basis. The Group continuously analyses the\\nraw materials prioritised in the report as well as other\\nmaterials essential for production with regard to their\\nimpact on the environment and society along the entire\\nsupply chain. By sourcing raw materials such as cobalt\\nand lithium directly, the BMW Group can establish traceability and transparency with regard to environmental\\nand social standards, which is critical for conducting due\\ndiligence in raw materials supply chains.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nProduction, Purchasing and Supplier Network\\n\\nRESPONSIBLE USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES\\n\\nIn addition to compliance with environmental\\nand social standards and respect for human rights, the\\nresponsible use of nature’s finite resources also plays a\\nmajor role.\\nWith the aim of protecting stocks of critical raw materials, by 2030 the BMW Group plans to significantly\\nincrease the percentage of recycled raw materials, i. e.\\nsecondary raw materials, that it uses and to reuse these\\nmaterials in line with circular economy principles. The\\ngrowth of e-mobility is causing the topic of circular\\neconomy to become increasingly important, as a variety\\nof critical raw materials are required to produce battery\\ncells. The use of secondary raw materials significantly\\nreduces the carbon footprint compared to primary materials: by a factor of 4 to 6 for aluminium and by a factor\\nof 2 to 5 for steel and thermoplastics.\\nAt its own plants, the BMW Group is gradually establishing closed recycling loops between the plants and\\nthe raw materials manufacturers, such as at the Landshut\\ncomponents plant. In late 2019, the foundry in Landshut\\nwas certified by the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative\\n(ASI) for its sustainable use of aluminium. Around half\\nof the aluminium used at the BMW Group’s Landshut\\nplant comes from a closed recycling loop. The Group is\\nconsciously reducing the use of carbon-intensive primary\\naluminium via this method.\\n\\n103\\n\\nCOMPREHENSIVE MEASURES AND COOPERATION IN A\\nSPIRIT OF PARTNERSHIP ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH\\nSUSTAINABILITY STANDARDS.\\n\\nWe can only succeed in achieving our sustainability goals by interacting with suppliers on the basis of\\nmutual cooperation. Ultimately, climate protection and\\ncompliance with environmental and social standards\\nare a challenge for the whole of society. As with quality,\\nsustainability is all about accomplishing ambitious goals\\nin close collaboration with the supplier network.\\nWith the aim of stepping up its efforts to ensure\\ndue diligence in the field of sustainability, since 2018\\nthe BMW Group has been involved in developing the\\nAutomotive Sustainability Assessment (ASA) in the\\nGerman Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA).\\nBased on these guidelines, the performance of essential\\ndue diligence procedures can now be audited in a standardised manner, even at the premises of medium-sized\\nsuppliers to the automotive industry. The BMW Group\\nalready applies the Responsible Business Alliance\\n(RBA) audit programme for major suppliers from the\\nelectronics industry. It also carries out qualification,\\nstandardisation and empowerment measures and holds\\ninformational events, particularly in the case of supply\\nchains exposed to a higher degree of risk. The aim is to\\nfurther develop and actively bring about transformation\\nat suppliers with regard to sustainability issues. In its\\nefforts to achieve this aim, the BMW Group leverages\\nboth individual and standardised elements of the Drive\\nSustainability Initiative and the Responsible Business\\nAlliance to integrate sustainability in business processes\\nsuch as procurement.\\n\\nElectric mobility can only be sustainable if the\\nraw materials it requires are also obtained as\\nsustainably as possible. Take lithium for\\nexample:\\nThe BMW Group currently sources lithium for its fifth generation of high-voltage batteries exclusively from Australia, where\\nthe material is extracted by means of a so-called hard rock mining process.\\nFurthermore, the Group has commissioned a study on sustainable lithium mining under the auspices of two renowned American\\nuniversities in order to scientifically investigate water consumption in the extraction of lithium. The purpose of the study, which\\nwill be jointly conducted by the University of Alaska-Anchorage\\nand the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, is to investigate\\nthe impact of lithium mining on local water supplies in Latin\\nAmerica.\\nLithium is the lightest metal on earth and is mainly used to produce batteries, ceramics, glass and aluminium. It is therefore\\nalso an essential material for producing lithium-ion batteries and\\nplays a key role in vehicle electrification.\\nTwo-thirds of the world’s lithium reserves are located in Latin\\nAmerica. To date, however, the impact of lithium mining in the region has not been sufficiently scientifically studied. The gap will\\nnow be closed by the study commissioned by the BMW Group.\\nBASF SE is also partially financing the study.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nProduction, Purchasing and Supplier Network\\n\\nVia the due diligence process, the BMW Group\\nchecks whether and how sustainability standards are being implemented by its suppliers. Suppliers contractually\\nundertake to comply with a range of requirements in line\\nwith their environmental (ISO 14001, EMAS) and occupational health and safety management systems (OHSAS\\n18001, ISO 45001) and to demand and maintain compliance with these agreements from their subcontractors.\\nIn 2020, the sustainability questionnaire for suppliers, which was initiated by the BMW Group in 2012\\nand jointly compiled by the automotive manufacturers,\\nwas comprehensively revised. The BMW Group’s Supply\\nChain Response Team processes any information regarding potential breaches of its sustainability standards in\\nthe supplier network. Furthermore, the BMW Group’s\\nHuman Rights Contact Supply Chain serves as the central point of contact and can be reached anonymously by\\ntelephone or email to report any potential violations of\\nsocial or environmental standards by suppliers.\\nThe BMW Group has agreed corrective measures with\\n64 % (2019: 62 %) of the suppliers at which sustainability\\nshortfalls were identified in the course of the reporting\\nyear.

Significant losses were\\nrecorded in Germany (– 5.0 %), France (– 8.3 %), Italy\\n(– 9.0 %) and Spain (– 11.0 %), the eurozone’s largest\\neconomies. With many areas of the economy completely paralysed at times due to lockdowns lasting several\\nweeks, both production and consumption slumped\\ndramatically. Unemployment rates rose in all countries,\\ndespite the increases being at least partially held down\\nby short-time work programmes. Governments across\\nthe region implemented extensive economic stimulus\\npackages to support their countries’ economies. The\\nassistance programmes caused government spending\\nto rise sharply in 2020, resulting in higher debt ratios in\\nthe respective countries.\\nGDP in the United Kingdom (UK) slumped by 10.7 %\\nin 2020. The performance was influenced not only by\\nthe consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, but also\\nby the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the terms of\\nthe Brexit trade deal, which would ultimately govern the\\nUK’s future relations with the European Union (EU).\\n\\nIn the USA, GDP fell by 3.5 % during the year under\\nreport. Due to the lockdowns and in the absence of\\nshort-time work programmes, the unemployment rate\\nrose significantly. Consumer sentiment and exports\\nboth slumped during various parts of the year. Both\\ncorporate investment and industrial production suffered\\na significant decline. In light of the ensuing economic\\nsituation, the US Federal Reserve (FED) further lowered\\nits benchmark interest rates in 2020.\\nAlthough China was the only economy to expand in\\n2020, its growth rate of 2.3 % was significantly down on\\nthe previous year. Consumer demand collapsed almost\\ncompletely during the spring lockdown.

The effective tax rate\\nfell to 26.1 % (2019: 30.1 %).

The swift measures\\ntaken at production level to adjust to the coronavirus\\nsituation also resulted in lower levels of inventories at\\ndealerships and simultaneously to a reduction in receivables from sales financing, primarily in the form of lower\\ncredit financing for dealerships. Advance tax payments\\nalso dropped year-on-year due to the lower earnings.\\nThe reduction in inventories had a positive impact on\\nthe change in working capital, whereas the decrease in\\ntrade payables, caused mainly by earlier plant closures\\nand stringent cost management, had an offsetting effect.\\nThe year-on-year change in cash flows from investing\\nactivities was positively influenced by the level of net outflows disbursed in 2019 for investment assets, primarily\\nfor the acquisition of the YOUR NOW companies. In addition, the higher level of investments in property, plant and\\nequipment and intangible assets in 2019 – particularly\\nfor the market launch of new vehicle models such as the\\nBMW 1 Series, the BMW 3 Series and the X5 – resulted in\\na year-on-year decrease in cash outflows. Proceeds from\\nthe sale of marketable securities also had a positive impact\\non the net cash outflow from investing activities.\\nThe net cash outflow from financing activities was\\nmainly attributable to lower financing requirements in\\nthe Financial Services segment and the related reduction\\nin bond issues, the reduced volume of asset-backed financing and the repayment of liabilities to banks.\\n\\n134\\n\\nREFINANCING\\n\\nA broad range of instruments on international money\\nand capital markets is used to refinance worldwide operations. The funds raised are used almost exclusively to\\nrefinance the BMW Group’s Financial Services business.\\nThe overall objective of Group financing is to ensure the\\nsolvency of the BMW Group at all times, focusing on\\nthree areas:\\n1. The ability to act through permanent access to strategically important capital markets\\n2. Autonomy through the diversification of refinancing\\ninstruments and investors\\n3. Focus on value through the optimisation of financing\\ncosts\\nFinancing measures undertaken at corporate level\\nensure access to liquidity for the Group’s operating subsidiaries at standard market conditions and consistent\\ncredit terms. Funds are acquired in line with a target\\nliability structure, comprising a balanced mix of financing instruments. The use of longer-term instruments to\\nrefinance the Group’s Financial Services business and\\nthe maintenance of a sufficiently high liquidity reserve\\nserves to rule out any imminent liquidity risk for the\\nportfolio. This conservative financial approach also has\\na favourable effect on the Group’s rating. Further information is provided in the section “Liquidity risks” within\\nthe “Report on Outlook, Risks and Opportunities”.\\n\\nFocused capital market management, good ratings and the high level of acceptance enjoyed by the\\nBMW Group on those markets enabled it to refinance\\nitself on the world’s debt capital markets at favourable\\nconditions during the period under report, despite the\\ntemporary impact of the coronavirus pandemic on those\\nmarkets. In addition to bonds, loan notes and private\\nplacements, the Group also issued commercial paper. As\\nin previous years, the issues were all in high demand,\\nnot only from institutional investors, but also from\\nprivate investors for selected transactions. In addition,\\nretail customer and dealership financing receivables as\\nwell as rights and obligations from leasing contracts are\\nsecuritised in the form of asset-backed securities (ABS)\\nfinancing arrangements. Specific banking instruments,\\nsuch as the customer deposits used by the Group’s own\\nbanks in Germany and the USA, are also deployed for\\nfinancing purposes.

Lower sales volumes due to\\nthe coronavirus pandemic and negative currency effects\\nwere partially offset by overall favourable product mix\\neffects brought about by the less pronounced drop in the\\nsale of high-revenue models.

The volume-related decline\\nin cost of sales was offset by expenses for various provisions, including those recognised in connection with\\nthe exhaust gas recirculation cooler and recalls (such as\\ncontaminated battery cells in plug-in hybrid vehicles).\\nIn addition, lower capitalised overhead costs due to\\nthe reduction of inventories accounted for at Group level\\nas well as higher expenses for depreciation and amortisation had the effect of increasing segment cost of sales\\nyear-on-year.\\nExpenses recognised for workforce measures were\\nlargely offset by lower expenses for performance-related\\nremuneration components.\\nThe net amount of other operating income and expenses improved by € 1,361 million, largely due to the\\nprovision recognised in relation with the EU Commission’s ongoing antitrust proceedings in the previous\\nfinancial year.*\\n\\n* Further information is provided in\\n\\nnote 10 to the Group Financial Statements.\\n\\n146\\n\\nThe segment EBIT margin (profit before financial\\nresult as a percentage of revenues) came in at 2.7 % (2019:\\n4.9 %': None, ' – 2.2 percentage points).

With\\nthe R18 Classic, BMW Motorrad is expanding its product\\nrange in the cruiser segment with the addition of a model\\nthat is also ideally suited for touring.\\nRevised models of the G 310 GS, the G 310 R and the\\nR 1250 RT were also presented in October and November.\\n\\nThe segment EBIT margin (profit before financial\\nresult as a percentage of revenues) came in at 4.5 % (2019:\\n8.2 %': None, ' – 3.7 percentage points) and thus within the most\\nrecently forecast target range of between 3 and 5 %.\\nProfit before tax for the year was significantly lower\\nthan one year earlier.\\nThe RoCE for the Motorcycles segment in 2020 was\\n15.0 %, significantly down on the previous year’s level\\n(2019: 29.4 %': None, ' – 14.4 percentage points), mainly due to\\nthe lower level of EBIT.\\nThe performance was in line with the outlook communicated in the quarterly statement to 30 September 2020, but well short of the Motorcycles segment’s\\nRoCE target valid through 2020 of 26 %.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport on Economic Position\\n\\nFINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT\\n\\nFINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS HELD DOWN BY\\nCORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\\n\\nIn a difficult environment dominated by the global\\nimpact of the coronavirus pandemic, business developed significantly less favourably for the Financial\\nServices segment in 2020 compared to one year earlier,\\na fact reflected in a 24.1 % drop in profit before tax to\\n€ 1,725 million (2019: € 2,272 million).

The net cash\\noutflow from financing activities mainly reflected the\\nrepayment of loans and the decrease in asset-backed\\nsecurities financing.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport on Economic Position\\n\\nCHANGE IN RISK PROFILE\\n\\nIn 2020, the risk profile across the Financial Services\\nsegment’s total portfolio was shaped primarily by the\\nvolatility arising due to the coronavirus pandemic and\\nthe resulting additional risk provisioning measures recognised in connection with expected credit and residual\\nvalue risks, mainly provisions and allowances to cover\\nfuture credit and / or residual value losses.\\nThe initial and continuous testing of customer creditworthiness is an important aspect of the BMW Group’s\\ncredit risk management. As explained in previous quarters, for accounting purposes the Financial Services\\nsegment has raised credit loss allowances over the course\\nof 2020 in order to reflect the potential longer-term\\neconomic impact of the coronavirus pandemic on retail\\nand dealership business. The amounts recognised were\\nbased on reasonable and appropriate market-specific\\ninformation and estimates available at the end of the\\nreporting period.\\nThe credit loss ratio on the total credit portfolio\\namounted to 0.21 % at 31 December 2020, and was therefore slightly lower than one year earlier (2019: 0.26 %).\\nMore specifically, the loss ratio stood at 0.16 % (2019:\\n0.15 %) for leasing business and 0.31 % (2019: 0.41 %) for\\ncredit financing business with retail customers. The overall improvement in the loss ratio was also attributable to\\ngovernment measures (such as payment moratoriums\\nor restrictions in the receivables management process)\\nimplemented in many countries around the world.\\n\\n153\\n\\nIn the premium segment for pre-owned vehicles,\\nremarketing selling prices for vehicles coming out of\\nleases developed positively overall in 2020. Whereas\\nrestrictions on sales and the lower supply of new vehicles had a negative impact on demand for new and\\npre-owned vehicles during the first lockdown, the market\\nsaw an upward trend during the second half of the year.\\nDespite this moderate recovery, economic development\\nremains exposed to an increased level of uncertainty due\\nto the pandemic. This point is particularly relevant for\\nthe development of prices for pre-owned premium segment vehicles in the short and medium term. Under the\\nprevailing circumstances, the BMW Group sees prices as\\nlikely to fluctuate significantly in subsequent quarters, as\\nin 2020, due to a number of factors, including possible\\nchanges in demand patterns or the renewal of temporary\\nrestrictions that could have an impact on the remarketing\\nprocess. Accordingly, in 2020 market-specific risk provisioning expenses were recognised relating to the vehicle\\nportfolio subject to residual value risks.\\nIn line with customary business practice, the Financial Services segment makes provision to take account\\nof significant business risks on an ongoing and comprehensive basis. Based on current assessments, however,\\nthe segment has recognised appropriate levels of provisions / allowances to cover residual value and credit risks.\\nFurther information on the segment’s risk profile is\\nprovided in the section on risks and opportunities and\\nin note 38 to the Group Financial Statements.\\n\\nDEVELOPMENT OF CREDIT LOSS RATIO\\n\\nin %\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n0.32\\n\\n0.34\\n0.25\\n\\n0.26\\n\\n0.25\\n\\n0.21\\n\\n0\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\n2018\\n\\n2019\\n\\n2020\\n\\nOTHER ENTITIES SEGMENT / ELIMINATIONS\\n\\nThe combined profit before tax in the Other Entities\\nsegment and eliminations saw a significant improvement\\nof € 483 million. This was attributable to reversal effects\\nfrom the leased products portfolios, lower eliminations\\ndue to the decline in new leasing business and the\\nlower expected new leasing business resulting from the\\nreduced levels of inventories at dealerships.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport on Economic Position\\n\\nCOMMENTS ON FINANCIAL\\nSTATEMENTS OF BMW AG\\n\\n154\\n\\nBayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft\\n(BMW AG), based in Munich, Germany, is the parent\\ncompany of the BMW Group. The comments on the\\nBMW Group and Automotive segment provided in earlier\\nsections apply to BMW AG, unless presented differently\\nin the following section. The Financial Statements of\\nBMW AG are drawn up in accordance with the provisions\\nof the German Commercial Code (HGB) and the relevant\\nsupplementary provisions contained in the German\\nStock Corporation Act (AktG).\\nThe key financial performance indicator for BMW AG\\nis the dividend payout ratio (unappropriated profit of\\nBMW AG in accordance with HGB in relation to net\\nprofit for the year of the BMW Group in accordance\\nwith IFRS). The key non-financial performance indicators\\nare essentially identical and concurrent with those of\\nthe BMW Group. These are described in detail in the\\nReport on Economic Position section of the Combined\\nManagement Report.\\nDifferences in accounting treatments based on HGB\\n(used for the Company Financial Statements) and IFRS\\n(used for the Group Financial Statements) are mainly\\nto be found in connection with the capitalisation of\\nintangible assets, the creation of valuation units, the\\nrecognition and measurement of financial instruments\\nand provisions as well as the recognition of deferred tax\\nassets. Differences also arise in the presentation of assets\\nand liabilities and of items in the income statement.\\n\\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND REVIEW OF OPERATIONS\\n\\nThe general and sector-specific environment\\nof BMW AG is essentially the same as that of the\\nBMW Group and is described in the Report on Economic\\nPosition section of the Combined Management Report.\\nBMW AG develops, manufactures and sells automobiles and motorcycles as well as spare parts and accessories manufactured in-house, by foreign subsidiaries and\\nby external suppliers, and performs services related to\\nthese products.

Mainly due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, automobile deliveries fell by 305,852 units\\nto 2,249,943 units in the financial year 2020. This figure\\nincludes 598,853 units relating to series sets supplied to\\nthe joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang, an increase of 64,215 units over the previous year.\\nAt 31 December 2020, BMW AG employed a workforce of 84,668 people (31 December 2019: 86,700 people,\\nadjusted). With effect from the financial year 2020, the\\nkey performance indicator for the size of the workforce\\ncomprises only core and temporary employees.

Strategy, Goals\\nand Management System. This is in line with the integrated\\napproach used by BMW Group to manage its business\\nsystematically on the basis of financial and sustainability\\ntargets.\\n\\nOUTLOOK\\nECONOMIC OUTLOOK\\n\\nThe BMW Group’s report on outlook, risks and\\nopportunities presents the expected development in\\n2021, including the main risks and opportunities from\\nthe perspective of the Group’s management. In line with\\nthe Group’s internal management system, the outlook\\ncovers a period of one year. Risks and opportunities\\nare managed on the basis of a two-year assessment. The\\nReport on Risks and Opportunities therefore addresses a period\\nof two years.\\nThe continuous forecasting process within the\\nBMW Group ensures that it is always ready to take advantage of opportunities as they arise, but also to react\\nappropriately to unexpected risks. The principal risks\\nand opportunities are described in detail in the Report\\non Risks and Opportunities. The matters discussed\\ntherein are relevant for all of the BMW Group’s key\\nperformance indicators and could result in variances\\nbetween the outlook and actual outcomes.\\n\\nAccording to the latest assessment of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global economy is projected\\nto grow by 5.5 % in 2021. Many countries are expected\\nto continue implementing a comprehensive range of\\nmonetary and fiscal policy measures in 2021, in a bid to\\nboost economies battered by the coronavirus pandemic.\\nMoreover, post-lockdown catch-up effects could generate\\nadditional momentum. Ultimately, however, the actual\\ngrowth rate will depend heavily on the success of the vaccination campaigns now underway. Potential new waves\\nof the virus and its mutations pose an additional risk.\\nFurther information on political and global economic\\nrisks is also provided in the Report on Risks and Opportunities.\\nThe eurozone economy is projected to grow by\\naround 4.3 % in 2021. The rate for Germany, however,\\nis likely to be somewhat lower (+ 3.6 %). The economic\\noutlook for the other eurozone member states is very\\npositive in some cases, with countries such as France\\n(+ 5.6 %), Italy (+ 4.6 %) and Spain (+ 5.7 %) expected to\\npost strong GDP growth over the forecast period.\\n\\nThe performance of the UK economy in 2021 will not\\nonly depend on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic,\\nbut also on that of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement\\nreached with the EU. The latest projection for the UK\\neconomy is a growth rate of 4.6 %.\\nThe US economy is also projected to grow considerably by 4.8 % in 2021. The US Federal Reserve is likely\\nto continue pursuing its low-interest-rate policies. At\\nthe same time, the stimulus packages announced by US\\nPresident Biden are expected to provide a boost to the\\neconomy.\\nThe Japanese economy, which has also been severely\\naffected by the pandemic, is projected to grow by 2.8 %\\nin 2021.\\nChina was the only economy to expand slightly in\\n2020. With a projected rate of 8.4 %, the Chinese economy is set to continue its growth course in 2021.\\n\\nCURRENCY MARKETS\\n\\nCurrencies of particular importance for the international operations of the BMW Group are the US dollar,\\nthe British pound, the Chinese renminbi and the Japanese yen. All of these major currencies are expected to\\nbe subject to a high degree of fluctuation in 2021.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport on Outlook, Risks and Opportunities\\n\\nIt seems reasonable to assume that the US Federal\\nReserve will continue its expansionary monetary policies\\nin 2021. The USA’s central bank may also be willing to\\nallow inflation to run at a rate higher than 2 % in future,\\neven over an extended period of time, thereby possibly\\nleading to further depreciation of the US dollar against\\nthe euro.\\nLooking at the Chinese renminbi, the close economic\\nties between the USA and China suggest that the currencies of these two countries will develop more or less\\nsynchronously. The renminbi is expected to depreciate\\nslightly against the euro in 2021.\\nIn 2021, the value of the British pound will be largely determined by the consequences of the agreement\\nreached between the UK government and the EU. In view\\nof the prevailing uncertainties, the exchange rate of the\\nrelatively weak pound is expected to move sideways over\\nthe course of 2021.\\nThe central bank in Japan is unlikely to change its\\nhighly expansionary monetary policy in 2021. For this\\nreason, the euro / yen exchange rate is also expected to\\nremain more or less stable.\\nThe currencies of numerous emerging markets could\\ncome under pressure against the US dollar and the euro\\ndue to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. This applies\\nin particular to countries such as Russia, Brazil and India.\\n\\n160\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL AUTOMOBILE MARKETS\\n\\nThe pandemic will continue to have a perceptible\\nimpact on international automobile markets in 2021.\\nAlthough new registrations are expected to rise to around\\n78 million units (+ 7.7 %), overall sales are likely to remain\\nsignificantly lower than before the coronavirus crisis.\\nEurope’s automobile markets are forecast to see significant growth (12.4 million units': None, ' + 4.2 %), albeit still\\nbelow pre-crisis levels. The latest forecast for Germany\\nindicates that new registrations may even decline slightly (2.9 million units': None, ' – 0.6 %). By contrast, considerable\\ngrowth is predicted for France (1.8 million units': None, ' + 9.1 %),\\nItaly (1.5 million units': None, ' + 9.0 %) and Spain (approximately\\n0.9 million units': None, ' + 4.3 %). Likewise, new registrations\\nin the UK are forecast to rise in 2021 (1.7 million units': None, '\\n+ 3.2 %).\\nThe negative trend in the USA is also expected to\\ncome to an end, at least for the time being. Based on\\ncurrent forecasts, the US market is set to grow in 2021\\nand reach a total of 16.0 million units (+ 9.8 %).\\nAccording to current estimates, passenger car registrations in China are likely to rise sharply year-on-year\\n(22.0 million units': None, ' + 7.6 %).\\nThe Japanese market is also expected to show a significant upward trend in 2021 (around 4.7 million units': None, '\\n+ 6.0 %).\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL AUTOMOBILE MARKETS\\n\\nChange\\nin registrations %\\n\\nEurope\\n\\n+ 4.2\\n\\nthereof Germany\\n\\n– 0.6\\n\\nthereof France\\n\\n+ 9.1\\n\\nthereof Italy\\n\\n+ 9.0\\n\\nthereof Spain\\n\\n+ 4.3\\n\\nthereof UK\\n\\n+ 3.2\\n\\nUSA\\n\\n+ 9.8\\n\\nChina\\n\\n+ 7.6\\n\\nJapan\\n\\n+ 6.0\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n+ 7.7\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL MOTORCYCLE MARKETS\\n\\nThe BMW Group expects worldwide motorcycle markets in the 250 cc plus class to grow slightly overall in\\n2021. After contracting in 2020, demand in Spain is likely\\nto see a solid recovery. Market volumes are expected to\\nbe slightly higher in Italy and slightly lower in Germany\\nand France. A slight contraction is also forecast for the\\nUS market. Brazil is expected to bounce back with a solid\\nrecovery. The market in China is set to grow sharply again\\nin 2021. As in the past year, motorcycle market demand\\nwill continue to be influenced by the course of the pandemic and its impact on the global economy in 2021.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport on Outlook, Risks and Opportunities\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT\\n\\nTrade relations between the USA and China should\\nimprove under the new US administration, whilst still\\nremaining strained. Low inflation rates give central\\nbanks sufficient headroom to continue their expansionary monetary policies. However, the rise in inﬂation\\nrates since the beginning of the year, especially in the\\neurozone, indicates that consumer prices are also likely\\nto increase again in the course of 2021.\\nWithin the eurozone, the course of the pandemic and\\ndelays in the vaccine rollout suggest that the pathway\\nback to normality could take some time yet. Any further\\nlockdowns during the first half of the year could dampen economic growth and hold down inflation figures,\\npotentially leaving the ECB with little flexibility to raise\\ninterest rates in 2021.\\nThe UK’s economy is not expected to improve significantly during the first quarter. Following the initial success of the vaccination programme, the UK government\\nis now looking to ease the lockdown on a cautious stepby-step basis. It remains to be seen, however, to what\\nextent the virus mutation circulating there could cause\\nthe situation to deteriorate again. In light of the fiscal\\nand monetary policy measures taken by the government\\nand the Bank of England, the economy is not expected to\\nsee an upturn before the summer. It is therefore safe to\\nassume that the Bank of England will keep interest rates\\nstable for the time being.\\n\\n161\\n\\nIn the USA, the House of Representatives has approved President Biden’s 1.9 trillion dollar stimulus package aimed at countering the impact of the pandemic on\\nthe economy. Despite inflation being expected to rise in\\n2021, the Federal Reserve seems determined to continue\\nits current programme of quantitative easing and leave\\nthe benchmark interest rate unchanged.\\nThe Chinese central bank is expected to maintain an\\nunchanged course. Despite strained trade relations with\\nthe USA, economic growth in China is likely to gather\\nadditional pace in 2021.\\n\\nAn unpredictable political environment may cause\\nactual economic growth in some regions to deviate from\\nexpected trends and developments. Areas affected in this\\ncontext include trade and customs policies, security and\\npotential additional international trade conflicts.\\nFurthermore, risks continue to exist for upstream\\nprocesses, including possible bottlenecks due to supply shortages arising in regions that could become the\\nfocus of a pandemic. Due to the high demand on international semiconductor markets, there is currently an\\nadditional risk of bottlenecks in the supply of electronic\\ncomponents to production. Risks and opportunities relating\\nto purchasing\\n\\nCONSEQUENCES FOR THE BMW GROUP\\n\\nFuture developments on international automobile\\nmarkets also have a direct impact on the BMW Group.\\nChallenges in the competitive environment as well as\\nthe course of the coronavirus pandemic are likely to\\nhave a significant impact on sales volumes. Due to its\\nglobal business model, the BMW Group is well placed\\nto capitalise on opportunities that present themselves,\\neven at short notice. Coordination between the Group’s\\nsales and production networks also enables it to even\\nout the impact of unforeseeable developments in various\\nregions. Moreover, investments in key future-oriented\\nmarkets form a sound basis for further growth, while\\nsimultaneously strengthening the global presence of the\\nBMW Group.\\n\\nThe BMW Group continues to observe these developments and is ready to implement all necessary measures\\nquickly and effectively.\\n\\nASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE OUTLOOK\\n\\nThe report on outlook, risks and opportunities contains forward-looking statements. These are based on the\\nBMW Group’s expectations and assessments and may be\\ninfluenced by unforeseeable events. As a result, actual\\noutcomes can deviate either positively or negatively from\\nthe expectations described below, among other things\\ndue to changes in the political and economic environment as well as the further course of the coronavirus\\npandemic. Report on Risks and Opportunities.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport on Outlook, Risks and Opportunities\\n\\nThe following outlook relates to a forecast period\\nof one year and is based on the composition of the\\nBMW Group during that time. The outlook takes account\\nof all information available at the time of reporting and\\nwhich could have an effect on the overall performance of\\nthe Group. The expectations contained in the outlook are\\nbased on the BMW Group’s forecast for 2021 and reflect\\nits most recent status. The basis for the preparation of\\nand the principal assumptions used in the forecasts –\\nwhich consider the consensual opinions of leading\\norganisations, such as economic research institutes and\\nbanks – are set out below. The BMW Group’s outlook\\ntakes account of these assumptions.\\nThe coronavirus pandemic will continue to have an\\nimpact on business performance in 2021 and hence on\\nthe results of operations, financial position and net assets\\nof BMW AG and the BMW Group. Due to the continuing\\nuncertainty surrounding the course and potential consequences of the pandemic going forward, it is difficult to\\nmake an accurate forecast of the BMW Group’s business\\nperformance in 2021. For the forecast year 2021, the\\nBMW Group is working on the basis that the original\\nwidespread prevalence of the infection that was the\\ndominant feature of 2020 will be replaced by recurrent,\\nregional hotspots. The outlook has been therefore been\\ndrawn up on the assumption that, outside of hot spots,\\nthe overall incidence of infection can be controlled\\nworldwide. The successive launch of vaccination campaigns and improved vaccine supply should also have\\nan increasingly positive effect in 2021.\\n\\n162\\n\\nUncertainties remain, however, as mutated strains\\nof the virus emerge and spread, raising questions about\\nthe efficacy of currently available vaccines in combatting mutations. It is not possible to assess the extent to\\nwhich such risks could impact the global economy, the\\nfinancial markets and therefore the BMW Group and,\\nfor this reason, they have not been taken into account\\nin the outlook.\\nWith demand on international semiconductor markets currently at a high level, the supply situation for\\nelectronic chips has become increasingly tense, which\\ncould result in supply bottlenecks affecting the availability of semiconductor components required for production.\\nThe BMW Group is monitoring the situation closely.\\nShould the situation deteriorate further and significant\\nsupply bottlenecks occur, it cannot be ruled out that this\\nwill have an adverse impact on the outlook.\\nThe BMW Group expects that the tensions between\\nthe USA and China will persist after the change in the\\nUS administration and remain a source of uncertainty.\\nHowever, based on up-to-date assessments, customs\\ntariffs are not expected to rise.\\nCurrent estimates and assumptions for the financial year 2021, to the extent already known to the\\nBMW Group, have been taken into account and described\\nin the outlook report. Beyond these assessments, no further significant opportunities and risks are known or can\\nbe estimated at the present time. However, it cannot be\\nruled out that the assumptions underlying estimates may\\nneed to be changed over the course of the year.\\n\\nOUTLOOK FOR THE BMW GROUP\\nOVERALL ASSESSMENT BY GROUP MANAGEMENT\\n\\nDespite the volatile situation brought about by the\\nglobal spread of coronavirus, the BMW Group expects\\nbusiness to develop positively and the risk situation to\\nremain stable in the financial year 2021. New automobile\\nand motorcycle models as well as individual mobility-related services are expected to generate momentum.\\nGroup profit before tax is therefore expected to rise\\nsignificantly during the outlook period.\\nThe Automotive segment is expected to record a solid\\nyear-on-year increase in the number of BMW, MINI and\\nRolls-Royce brand vehicles delivered to customers. At the\\nsame time, the BMW Group is targeting a further significant reduction in carbon emissions in the new vehicle\\nfleet ¹, calculated using the revised base ². In addition to\\nimprovements achieved through developments in highly\\nefficient combustion engines, the expected reduction also\\nreflects the significant increase in the forecast proportion\\nof electrified vehicles sold. According to the planning,\\ncarbon emissions per vehicle produced are likely to fall\\nmoderately. The Automotive segment’s EBIT margin is set\\nto recover in 2021, most likely finishing within a range of\\n6 to 8 % and thus causing the segment RoCE to improve\\nsignificantly.\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\nEU including Norway and Iceland': None, ' since 2018 figure based on WLTP (Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles\\nTest Procedure) and converted back to the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC).\\nEfficiency indicator calculated on the basis of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (i. e. a market-based method\\naccording to GHG protocol Scope 2 guidance that excludes climate-changing gases other than carbon dioxide)\\nof vehicle production excluding motorcycles, adjusted for CHP losses and divided by the total number of\\nvehicles produced, including the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang, but excluding\\nvehicles produced by the contract manufacturers Magna Steyr and Nedcar.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport on Outlook, Risks and Opportunities\\n\\nThe RoE in the Financial Services segment is expected to finish within a range of 12 to 15 %. The switch to\\na forecast corridor for RoE allows for a narrower and\\ntherefore more precise outlook.\\nThe Motorcycles segment is expected to record a solid\\nincrease in deliveries to customers. The EBIT margin is\\npredicted to lie within the target range of 8 to 10 %, enabling the segment to record a significantly higher level\\nof RoCE than one year earlier.\\nThe proportion of women in management positions\\nin the BMW Group is expected to increase slightly.\\nThe targets described above are to be met with a\\nslightly lower number of employees.\\nOngoing uncertainty, particularly regarding the further course of the coronavirus pandemic, macroeconomic\\nand political developments as well as international trade\\nand customs policies, could cause economic conditions in\\nmany regions to differ quite considerably from expected\\ntrends and developments. All these factors could have\\nsignificant effects on the overall business performance of\\nthe BMW Group. Furthermore, the Group’s actual business performance may also differ from current expectations as a result of the risks and opportunities discussed\\nbelow in the Report on Risks and Opportunities.\\n\\n163\\n\\nBMW GROUP KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\\n\\n2020\\nreported\\n\\n2020\\nadjusted\\n\\n2021\\nOutlook 1\\n\\n5,222\\n\\n–\\n\\nSignificant increase\\n\\n120,726\\n\\n–\\n\\nSlight decrease\\n\\nGROUP\\nProfit before tax\\n\\n€ million\\n\\nWorkforce at year-end\\nShare of women in management positions\\nin the BMW Group\\n\\n%\\n\\n17.8\\n\\nunits\\n\\n2,324,809\\n\\n%\\n\\n8.3\\n\\nSlight increase\\n\\n–\\n\\nAUTOMOTIVE SEGMENT\\nDeliveries to customers 2\\nShare of electrified vehicles in deliveries\\n\\nSolid increase\\n\\n–\\n\\nSignificant increase\\n\\nCO2-Emissions EU New Vehicle Fleet 3\\n\\ng / km\\n\\nCO2 emissions per vehicle produced 4\\n\\ntons\\n\\n0.23\\n\\n%\\n\\n2.7\\n\\n–\\n\\nbetween 6 and 8\\n\\n%\\n\\n12.7\\n\\n–\\n\\nSignificant increase\\n\\nEBIT margin\\nReturn on capital employed\\n\\n5\\n\\n99 6\\n\\n–\\n135 7\\n0.31\\n\\n8\\n\\nSignificant decrease\\nModerate decrease\\n\\nMOTORCYCLES SEGMENT\\nDeliveries to customers\\n\\nunits\\n\\n169,272\\n\\n–\\n\\nSolid increase\\n\\nEBIT margin\\n\\n%\\n\\n4.5\\n\\n–\\n\\nbetween 8 and 10\\n\\nReturn on capital employed 5\\n\\n%\\n\\n15.0\\n\\n–\\n\\nSignificant increase\\n\\n%\\n\\n11.2\\n\\n–\\n\\nbetween 12 and 15\\n\\nFINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT\\nReturn on equity\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n\\n8\\n\\nBased on adjusted outlook': None, ' see\\nGlossary for the definition of terminology / ranges used in forecasting.\\nIncluding the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang (2020: 602,247 units).\\nEU including Norway and Iceland': None, ' since 2018 value converted WLTP (Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure) basis.\\nEfficiency indicator calculated from Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2 emissions (market-based method according to GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance.

The CO2 fleet emissions\\nforecast for 2021 is based on WLTP in accordance with legal requirements and includes fewer offsetting factors due to the fact that phase-in is no longer permitted for 2021 and the BMW Group fully utilised the maximum amount\\nof super-credits in 2020. For better comparability of the CO2 fleet emissions forecast for 2021 and the fleet value for 2020, the 2020 figure has been converted internally from an NEDC basis (including offsetting factors) to a WLTP\\nbasis (excluding offsetting factors). The figure derived for 2020 serves only to enable reconciliation with the 2021 figure: it is not official and does not correspond to legislation that was in place in 2020.\\nFrom 2021, CO2 emissions according to Scope 1 and 2 include not only production emissions but also emissions at locations not allocated to production, e. g. research centres, distribution centres, office buildings.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport on Outlook, Risks and Opportunities\\n\\nRISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\\n\\nAs a globally leading provider of premium automobiles, motorcycles, mobility services and financial\\nservices, the BMW Group is exposed to an array of uncertainties and changes. To ensure growth, profitability,\\nefficiency and continued sustainability going forward, the\\nBMW Group needs to take well calculated risks and make\\nfull use of any opportunities that present themselves.\\nThe management of opportunities and risks is essential in order to respond in an appropriate manner to any\\nchanges that occur in political, economic, technical or legal conditions. The BMW Group has put a comprehensive\\nrisk management system in place to effectively with risks\\nas they arise. The aim of the risk management system\\nis to identify, assess and actively manage any risks that\\ncould threaten the attainment of the Group’s corporate\\ntargets. As part of that process, individual and cumulative\\nrisks capable of posing a threat to the profitability of the\\nbusiness are monitored and managed.\\nAll opportunities and risks expected to materialise\\nhave already been addressed in the Outlook Report. The\\nfollowing sections focus on potential future developments\\nor events that could result in a positive (opportunity)\\nor a negative deviation (risk) from the outlook for the\\nBMW Group.\\n\\n164\\n\\nOVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK\\nAND OPPORTUNITIES SITUATION\\n\\nThe assessment of the overall risk situation is based\\non a consolidated view of all significant individual risks.\\nThe overall risk situation for the BMW Group has worsened moderately compared to one year earlier, reflecting –\\nin the worst-case scenario – a significant deterioration\\nin the global economic situation due to the coronavirus\\npandemic. The BMW Group has already adjusted its sales\\nand production planning to take account of expected\\nmacroeconomic developments and incorporated their\\nimpact in the outlook. Should the effect of the pandemic\\nprove less severe in 2021 and if the economy recovers\\nmore quickly than expected, opportunities for both revenues and earnings could arise.\\nManagement does not see any threat to the\\nBMW Group’s status as a going concern. Similar to one\\nyear earlier, the current set of risks to the BMW Group\\nare considered manageable. If these risks – or opportunities – were to materialise, they could have an impact\\non underlying key performance indicators, thus causing\\ndeviations from the outlook. The BMW Group’s financial resources are stable, with liquidity requirements\\ncurrently covered by existing liquidity and available\\nfinancing instruments.\\nIn addition to the risks described below, unforeseen\\nevents could have a negative impact on business operations and hence on the BMW Group’s results of operations, financial position and net assets as well as on its\\nreputation.\\n\\nORGANISATION OF RISK MANAGEMENT\\n\\nRisk management is organised as a decentralised,\\nGroup-wide network and steered by a centralised risk\\nmanagement function. Every BMW Group division is represented by Network Representatives. This formal structure reinforces the network’s visibility and underlines the\\nimportance of risk management within the BMW Group.\\nThe responsibilities and duties of the centralised risk\\nmanagement function and the Network Representatives\\nare clearly documented and understood. Significant risks\\nreported from within the network are firstly presented\\nfor review to the Risk Management Steering Committee,\\nwhich is chaired by Group Controlling. After review,\\nany significant risks identified are reported to both the\\nBoard of Management and the Supervisory Board’s Audit\\nCommittee.\\nOther functions such as Compliance and Human Rights and\\nthe Internal Control System serve as key interfaces to the risk\\nmanagement system. In its capacity as an independent\\ncontrol body, Corporate Audit reviews the risk management system established by the Board of Management\\non an annual basis.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport on Outlook, Risks and Opportunities\\n\\n165\\n\\nRISK MANAGEMENT IN THE BMW GROUP\\n\\nRISK MEASUREMENT\\n\\nGroup-wide\\nrisk management\\n\\nIdentification\\n\\nAnalysis and\\nMeasurement\\n\\nEffectiveness\\nPracticability\\n\\nCompliance\\nCommittee\\n\\nReporting /\\nMonitoring\\n\\nControlling\\n\\nRisk Management Steering\\nCommittee\\n\\nCompleteness\\nMeasures\\n\\nSupervisory\\nBoard\\nBoard of\\nManagement\\n\\nGroup\\nAudit\\n\\nInternal Control System\\n\\nAccording to Group-wide guidelines, every employee\\nand manager has a duty to report risks via the relevant\\nreporting channels. The key elements of an effective risk\\nculture are embedded in the BMW Group’s core values,\\nin its risk management guidelines and in the risk strategy.\\nNew information and new requirements are continuously fed into the BMW Group’s risk management system,\\nthereby ensuring its ongoing development. Training\\nprogrammes and informational events are regularly conducted across the BMW Group, particularly within the\\n\\nrisk management network. These measures are essential\\nways of preparing those involved in the process to comply\\nwith any new or additional requirements.\\nThe risk management process applies across the\\nentire Group and comprises the early identification,\\nanalysis and assessment of risks, the coordinated use of\\nappropriate management tools and the monitoring and\\nevaluation of the measures taken.\\n\\nThe BMW Group utilises standardised methods to\\nassess risks. All significant risks are measured using\\nvalue-at-risk models and assessed on the basis of uniform loss distribution metrics, thereby enabling better\\ncomparability of risks for both internal and external\\nreporting purposes. The overall effect of risks on the\\nresults of operations, financial and net assets position\\nis referred to in the following sections uniformly as\\n“earnings impact”.\\nRisks are classified both according to their potential\\nimpact on earnings (worst-case scenario) and according\\nto the risk amount (average earnings impact, taking into\\naccount the probability of occurrence). The impact of\\nrisks is measured and reported net of any mitigation\\nmeasures that are already taking effect (net basis).

Significant risks in this\\ncontext are defined as those stemming from business\\n\\nactivities, business relationships and products and / or\\nservices provided by the BMW Group that are highly\\nlikely to have a seriously adverse impact. No significant\\nnon-financial risks were identified during the year under\\nreport.\\n\\nOPPORTUNITIES MANAGEMENT\\n\\nA dynamic market environment also gives rise to opportunities. Identifying these opportunities is an integral\\npart of the BMW Group’s strategic planning process. The\\nGroup’s range of products and services is continually\\nreviewed on the basis of these analyses, resulting, for\\nexample, in new product projects being presented to\\nthe Board of Management for consideration. In order to\\ncompete successfully in the long term and at the same\\ntime effectively help play an active role in achieving the\\ngoal of climate neutrality – as called for by politicians\\nand desired by society in general – the Group’s vehicle\\nplatforms are designed to operate flexibly with various\\ntypes of drivetrain, enabling it to respond more swiftly\\nto changing customer needs.\\nThe continuous monitoring of key business processes\\nand strict cost controls are also essential for ensuring\\nhigh levels of profitability and return on capital employed.\\nOnce identified, opportunities are acted upon in\\nthe relevant operational areas on a decentralised basis.\\nThe importance of opportunities for the BMW Group is\\nclassified on a qualitative basis in the categories “significant” and “insignificant”.

Unforeseen disruptions in global\\neconomic relations can have highly unpredictable effects.\\nMacroeconomic risks due to sales volume fluctuations\\ncould have a high earnings impact over the two-year\\nassessment period. The risk amounts attached to macroeconomic risks are classified as high.\\nCurrently, the greatest risk for the global economy\\nis the further spread and the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. Considerable uncertainty remains\\nregarding the dynamics of the coronavirus pandemic\\ngoing forward, despite the current decline in infection\\nfigures. The situation is highly dependent on the progress and success of the vaccination campaigns currently\\nunderway. It is not currently possible to predict with any\\ndegree of certainty the point in time from which a high\\nvaccination rate could significantly mitigate the course of\\nthe pandemic. As a result, restrictions to public life and\\nregional lockdowns are likely to be a continued source\\nof uncertainty for consumers and weigh heavily on the\\nsales situation across all markets. The BMW Group is\\nmonitoring the situation on a continuous basis and taking appropriate measures as required.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport on Outlook, Risks and Opportunities\\n\\nHowever, risks that existed prior to the outbreak of the\\npandemic still remain, despite being partially displaced\\nin the public perception. The trade conflict between the\\nUSA and China is likely to be an enduring topic, despite\\nthe inauguration of the new US president. However, the\\nfocus could well shift from pure tariff increases to import\\nand export restrictions on certain technologies. The potential introduction of further trade restrictions on both\\nsides could have a significantly adverse impact on the\\nBMW Group’s business operations due to less favourable\\nconditions for importing vehicles.\\nIn the wake of ongoing climate change, natural\\ndisasters could occur more frequently and impact the\\nBMW Group in a variety of ways. For instance, economic\\nactivity in the affected regions could be negatively influenced. For consumers, this would mean a loss of income\\nand the threat of unemployment and have a negative\\neffect on sales. In the context of its “Adaptation to Climate\\nChange” project, the BMW Group is preparing for numerous possible scenarios and has taken the step of systematically integrating the reporting of opportunities and risks\\nassociated with climate change within this report.\\n\\n168\\n\\nand its economic partners could result in significantly\\nstronger sales volume growth, reduced competitive\\npressures and improved pricing. Against this backdrop,\\nmacroeconomic opportunities capable of generating a\\nsustainably positive impact on earnings are currently\\nclassiﬁed by the BMW Group as signiﬁcant.\\n\\nSTRATEGIC AND SECTOR-SPECIFIC RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES': None, ' CHANGES IN LEGISLATION AND REGULATORY\\nREQUIREMENTS\\n\\nOther risks to the economy include political instability\\nin Belarus, the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan,\\npolitical unrest in the USA, the impact of the change in\\nHong Kong’s status, and uncertainty regarding the sustainability of debt levels in some European countries.\\n\\nThe short-term introduction of more stringent legislation and regulations, particularly with regard to emissions, safety and consumer protection as well as regional,\\nvehicle-related purchase and usage taxes, represents a\\nsignificant risk for the automobile industry. Countryand sector-specific trade barriers can also be subject to\\nchange at short notice. Any sudden tightening of regulations in these areas could necessitate significantly higher\\ninvestments and ongoing expenses or exert influence on\\ncustomer behaviour. If the risk of market disruption due\\nto unforeseeable short-term changes in legislation and\\nregulations were to materialise, this could have a highly\\nnegative earnings impact over the two-year assessment\\nperiod and beyond. The resulting risk amounts are therefore classified as high.\\n\\nIf the coronavirus is overcome with the help of effective vaccines over the course of 2021, opportunities\\ncould arise for the BMW Group in terms of revenues\\nand earnings. Significantly higher GDP growth in our\\nstrongest sales regions, positive signals in Europe and\\nthe USA on the back of new economic stimulus packages,\\nand a de-escalation of the trade conflict between the USA\\n\\nAt present, the BMW Group sees a continuous trend\\ntowards increasingly stringent vehicle emissions regulations, particularly for conventional drivetrain systems.\\nThe BMW Group is addressing this risk primarily by systematically electrifying its entire portfolio of brands and\\nmodels: based on its existing plans, the BMW Group will\\nalready have 25 electrified models on the road by 2023.\\n\\nAt the same time, the Group is pressing ahead with the\\ncontinued development of highly efficient combustion\\nengines in order to further reduce fuel consumption\\nand emissions.\\nAdditional risks could result from the tightening of\\nexisting import and export regulations, which could,\\nin turn, lead primarily to additional expenses, but also\\ncomplicate the import and export of vehicles and parts.\\nChanges in trade policies could also have a positive\\nimpact on the BMW Group’s earnings in the short to\\nmedium term. Any reduction in tariff barriers, import\\nrestrictions or direct excise duties could result in lower\\nmanufacturing costs or enable products and services to\\nbe offered to customers at more attractive prices. Further\\nopportunities to improve the BMW Group’s earnings\\nperformance due to changes in legislation and regulatory\\nrequirements compared to the outlook are classified as\\ninsignificant.\\nMarket developments\\nApart from economic factors and sector-specific\\npolitical conditions, increasingly fierce competition\\namong established manufacturers and the emergence of\\nnew market competitors could also have effects that are\\ndifficult to predict. Unforeseen consumer preferences\\nand changes in brand perceptions can also give rise\\nto both opportunities and risks. If market risks were\\nto materialise, they could have a high earnings impact\\nover the two-year assessment period. The risk amount\\nis classified as high.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport on Outlook, Risks and Opportunities\\n\\nA potential further intensification in terms of competition could put pressure on sales volumes, selling\\nprices and margins. For instance, the BMW Group could\\nbe confronted with supply and demand distortions in\\nthe transition from conventionally powered vehicles\\nto alternative drivetrain concepts, despite complying\\nwith legal requirements. Customer behaviour can also\\nalter due to changes in attitudes, values, environmental\\nfactors and fuel or energy prices. The flexibility of the\\nBMW Group’s sales and production processes makes\\nit possible to mitigate risks and take any opportunities\\narising in corresponding market and product segments.\\nLocal product usage restrictions in specific sectors\\ncould have a limiting impact on the BMW Group’s sales\\nin individual markets. In some urban areas, for instance,\\nlocal measures have been, or are being, introduced,\\nincluding entry restrictions, congestion charges or, in\\nsome situations, highly restrictive registration rules.\\nThese could influence local demand for the BMW Group\\nvehicles affected and hence have a negative impact on\\nsales, margins and, possibly, the residual values of these\\nvehicles. Among other measures, the BMW Group is addressing this risk by broadening its range of electrified\\nvehicles and mobility services.\\nMoreover, the BMW Group continuously monitors\\nits sales markets with the aim of increasing added value\\nfor customers and making the most of opportunities in\\nterms of sales volume growth and pricing. The further\\ndevelopment of the product and mobility portfolio as\\nwell as expansion in growth regions offer the greatest\\nmedium- to long-term growth opportunities for the\\nBMW Group. This depends above all on the Group’s\\nability to develop innovative products and services and\\nbring them to market. If the negative impact of the current competitive situation is reduced more quickly than\\n\\n169\\n\\nexpected, additional opportunities are likely to arise for\\nthe BMW Group. Compared to the assumptions made\\nin the outlook, the BMW Group does not expect these\\nopportunities to have a significant earnings impact over\\nthe two-year assessment period.\\n\\ncover the risk of fire-related events that lead to significant\\nproduction interruptions at the Group’s or at suppliers’\\npremises.\\nThe BMW Group’s successful business continuity\\nmanagement concept helps minimise downtimes in the\\nevent of a production stoppage and make up for lost\\nproduction volumes as quickly as possible.\\n\\nRISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES RELATING TO OPERATIONS\\n\\nRisks and opportunities relating to production and\\ntechnologies\\nRisks relating to production processes and fields of\\ntechnology can lead to unplanned production interruptions or additional costs due to vehicle recalls. If any\\nsuch risks were to materialise, they could have a high\\nearnings impact over the two-year assessment period.\\nThe corresponding risk amounts are classified as high.\\nPotential causes of production downtimes include\\nfires, infrastructural damage, machine and tooling breakdowns, IT malfunctions, temporary disruptions in utility\\nsupply or transportation and logistical disruptions, or\\nthe outbreak of a pandemic. All production units have a\\nvariety of measures in place to deal with potential production interruptions and downtimes, some of which are\\nalready integrated in the planning process and can be\\nimplemented operationally with a high degree of flexibility. These measures have an effect on both the amount of\\ndamage and the probability of the risks occurring.\\nTechnical fire protection, rapid response by on-site\\nfire brigades and appropriate employee training are the\\nkey strategies for preventing and reducing any potential\\ndamage from fires. Furthermore, policies are in place\\nwith insurance companies of high credit standing to\\n\\nFlexible working time models and working time\\naccounts designed to manage employee deployment,\\ncoupled with the ability to build individual vehicle models or engine types with a high degree of flexibility at\\nother BMW Group plants as required, make a significant\\ncontribution to ensuring that fluctuations in demand can\\nbe met.\\nDetect-analyse-respond measures have been rolled\\nout to counter the threat of targeted cyberattacks, reflecting the fact that such attacks could cause damage\\nto production facilities, resulting in long downtimes and\\nsubstantial losses.\\nVehicles may be damaged or destroyed by natural\\nhazards or other risks during transport from production\\nplants to the sales regions. Due to the growing number\\nof major claims, deductible amounts included in transport insurance policies have risen significantly. In fact,\\nas more and more insurance companies withdraw from\\nthis market segment, there is a risk that it could become\\neconomically unviable to take out insurance, as a result\\nof which the BMW Group would be required to bear the\\nlosses itself.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport on Outlook, Risks and Opportunities\\n\\nThe BMW Group recognises appropriate provisions\\nfor statutory and non-statutory warranty obligations. It\\ncannot be ruled out, however, that additional costs arise\\nin conjunction with vehicle recalls that are either not\\ncovered or not fully covered by provisions. Despite thorough quality assurance processes, such risks can always\\narise if the materials and / or processing procedures used\\nprove insufficient, in some cases years after a product is\\nlaunched. Further information on risks in conjunction\\nwith provisions for statutory and non-statutory warranty\\nobligations is provided in note 33 to the Group Financial\\nStatements.\\nThe BMW Group sees opportunities relating to\\nproduction processes and fields of technology primarily\\nin the competitive edge gained by mastering new and\\ncomplex technologies. Innovations in the technologies\\ndeployed and in IT in general are driving the pace of\\ndigitalisation in production processes. Given the long\\nlead times involved in developing new products and\\nprocesses, additional opportunities are not expected to\\nhave a significant earnings impact for the BMW Group\\nduring the outlook period.\\nRisks and opportunities relating to purchasing\\nPurchasing risks relate primarily to supply risks\\ncaused by the failure of a supplier to deliver as well as\\nto threats to BMW Group-relevant know-how within\\nthe supplier network. Production problems at supplier\\nlevel could lead to consequences caused by increased\\nexpenditure for the BMW Group due to production interruptions and a corresponding reduction in vehicle sales.\\nThe BMW Group deploys an extensive set of checks and\\nproactive management measures to tackle the challenges\\ncurrently facing the automotive supply industry. If purchasing risks were to materialise, they could have a high\\n\\n170\\n\\nearnings impact over the two-year assessment period.\\nThe risk amount attached to purchasing risks is classified\\nas high.\\nClose cooperation between carmakers and suppliers\\nin the development and production of vehicles and the\\nprovision of services generates economic benefits, but\\nalso raises levels of dependency. Potential reasons for\\nthe failure of individual suppliers to deliver include, in\\nparticular, IT-related risks, non-compliance with sustainability or quality standards and the occurrence of\\nnatural hazards and fires. Insufficient financial capacity\\non the part of individual suppliers could also jeopardise\\nsupplies to production plants. In this context, additional\\ncountermeasures have been put in place in the wake of\\nthe coronavirus pandemic.\\nMoreover, any major deterioration of a particular\\ncountry’s national security situation is incorporated in\\nthe risk measurement process as a potential reason for\\nthe failure of a value and / or supply chain. Any risks\\npotentially arising for individual suppliers and / or entire\\nsupply chains in conjunction with the need to adapt to\\nthe consequences of climate change are continually assessed on the basis of in-house expert knowledge, taking\\nscientific findings into due account.\\nThe growing complexity of the supplier network, particularly in the case of sub-suppliers whose operations\\ncan only be indirectly monitored by the BMW Group, is\\na further potential cause of downtimes at supplier locations. For instance, there is a risk that strong demand\\non international semiconductor markets gives rise to\\nbottlenecks in the supply of electronic components for\\nproduction. The increased threat of cyberattacks along\\nthe entire value chain also affects supply security as\\n\\nwell as the ability to protect know-how relevant to the\\nBMW Group. To ensure a uniform level of IT security for\\nall those involved along the value and supply chain, the\\nBMW Group impresses on suppliers the importance of\\nobtaining appropriate IT security certification.\\nBy monitoring and developing global supplier markets, the BMW Group continuously strives to become\\nmore competitive by working together with the world’s\\nbest product and service providers. As part of its supplier\\npreselection process, the BMW Group checks for compliance with the sustainability standards established for\\nits supplier network. This includes due consideration of\\nand compliance with internationally recognised human\\nrights and applicable labour and social standards.\\nThe level of carbon emissions generated by prospective suppliers is taken into account as an independent\\ncriterion when processing tenders and awarding new\\ncontracts. This approach ensures that first-tier suppliers\\nregard the issue of carbon emissions – alongside other\\nfactors – as relevant for their business and, in turn, set\\ntargets for other supply chain levels in which they are\\ninvolved. The aim is to reduce carbon emissions across\\nall relevant supply chains on the basis of constructive\\ncooperation with suppliers. It is important to point out,\\nhowever, that the BMW Group depends on receiving\\naccurate information from suppliers in this regard.\\nFurthermore, fire risks at series suppliers are evaluated by means of questionnaires and selective on-site\\ninspections. Suppliers are required to implement the\\nnecessary measures on a continuous basis. Following\\nevaluation, the results are fed back into the process for\\nawarding contracts for new projects.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport on Outlook, Risks and Opportunities\\n\\nThe risks associated with the supply of raw materials\\nare mitigated either by reducing the use of raw materials\\nor substituting them with alternative products.\\nWithin the Purchasing and Supplier Network, opportunities arise above all in the area of global sourcing and\\nthe associated efficiency improvements. Making optimal\\nuse of any innovations developed by suppliers is a key\\nprerequisite for developing future-oriented mobility products and services. Similarly, favourable location-related\\ncost factors, in particular those arising due to the close\\nproximity of supplier structures to new and existing\\nBMW Group production plants as well as the introduction of innovative production technologies, could lead to\\nlower cost of materials for the BMW Group.\\nOne of the BMW Group’s aims is to have battery cells\\nmanufactured in Europe. Key prerequisites for achieving\\nthis aim, however, are primarily further advances in the\\ndevelopment of battery cell technology and the mastery\\nof cell production processes. Contracts have been concluded with various suppliers as part of the Group’s electrification strategy. A further source of opportunities is\\nseen in the possible integration of previously unidentified\\nsupplier-driven innovations in the Group’s product range.\\nThe BMW Group offers innovative suppliers numerous\\noptions for creating specific contractual arrangements\\nthat promote companies developing innovative solutions.\\nCompared to the assumptions made in the outlook, the\\nBMW Group does not expect such additional opportunities to have a significant earnings impact over the\\ntwo-year assessment period.\\nRisks and opportunities relating to the sales network\\nIn order to sell its products and services, the\\nBMW Group operates a global sales network mainly comprising independent dealerships, branches, subsidiaries\\n\\n171\\n\\nand importers. In addition, a pilot project to promote\\ndirect sales was launched in South Africa in 2020. Any\\nthreat to the continued activities of parts of the sales\\nnetwork, for example due to the impending insolvency\\nof a dealership, would entail risks for the BMW Group.\\nThe occurrence of sales and marketing risks would have\\nonly a low earnings impact over the two-year assessment\\nperiod. The risk amount is classified as low.\\nNew developments in the field of digital communication and connectivity provide new opportunities for the\\nBMW Group’s brands to take advantage of additional\\nsales channels in their efforts to bring new products to\\nmarket. Based on vehicle-driven telematics data, customers can elect to use a specific service and actively consent\\nto the relevant data being transferred. The service providers contracted to perform the work receive the necessary\\ndata via the BMW Group’s secure back end system. The\\ninformation forms the basis for customised, data-driven,\\ninnovative service options. Additional oppor tunities\\ncould arise if new sales channels contribute to greater\\nbrand reach to customer groups than currently envisaged\\nin the outlook. Compared to the assumptions made in\\nthe outlook, the BMW Group does not expect these\\nopportunities to have a significant earnings impact over\\nthe two-year assessment period.\\nInformation security, data protection and IT\\nThe advance of digitalisation throughout all areas of\\nthe business world places considerable demands on the\\nconfidentiality, integrity and availability of electronically processed data and the associated use of information\\ntechnology (IT). Alongside higher threat levels in this\\narea, regulatory requirements worldwide relating to\\nthe use of personal data are becoming increasingly\\nstringent, for example due to the California Consumer\\nPrivacy Act. If risks relating to information security,\\n\\ndata protection and IT were to materialise, they could\\nhave a high earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. Despite extensive security measures and\\nconstant efforts to ensure compliance with applicable\\ndata protection legislation, the risk amount in this area\\nis classified as high.\\nIn addition to cyberattacks and direct physical intervention, there is a risk that either a lack of knowledge\\nor misconduct on the part of employees could also pose\\na danger to the confidentiality, integrity and availability\\nof information, data and systems. The main direct consequences could range from negative effects on revenues\\ndue to the misuse of information through to disruption\\nin the production of components or vehicles. A further\\nindirect consequence could be reputational damage.\\nThe BMW Group places great emphasis on protecting\\nthe confidentiality, integrity and availability of information from unauthorised access or misuse, whether relating to business, employees or customers. Data security\\nis an integral part of all Group business processes and\\npractised in accordance with the ISO / IEC 27001 international standard. In conjunction with risk management\\nrequirements, risks relating to information security, data\\nprotection and IT are systematically documented, allocated appropriate measures by the departments concerned\\nand continuously monitored with regard to threat level\\nand risk mitigation. Regular analyses and controls as\\nwell as rigorous security management policies ensure\\nan appropriate level of security.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport on Outlook, Risks and Opportunities\\n\\nHowever, despite continuous testing and preventive\\nsecurity measures, it is impossible to eliminate risks completely in this area. All Group employees are required to\\ntreat information such as confidential business, customer\\nand employee data with care, use information systems securely and handle risks in a transparent manner. Groupwide requirements are documented in a comprehensive\\nset of principles, guidelines and instructions, such as, for\\nexample, the Privacy Corporate Rules for handling personal data. Regular communication, awareness-raising\\nand training measures form the basis for a high level of\\nsecurity and risk awareness. With regard to cooperations\\nand business partnerships, the BMW Group protects its\\nintellectual property as well as its customer and employee\\ndata by issuing clearly defined instructions on information security, data protection and the use of information\\ntechnology. Trade secrets and sensitive personal data\\nare subject to particularly stringent security measures.\\nTechnical data protection incorporates industry-wide\\nstandards and good practices. Responsibility for information security and data protection for each Group entity\\nlies with either the Board of Management or the relevant\\nmanagement team.\\nWith the advance of digitalisation, the BMW Group\\nis continually improving the customer experience in its\\nexisting lines of business. At the same time, new business segments are emerging, which have only become\\nfeasible due to innovation in the field of information\\ntechnology. The development and provision of digital services for customers, increased vehicle connectivity and\\nautomated driving solutions are opening up new opportunities. Via BMW ConnectedDrive and BMW CarData,\\nthe range of services and apps on offer to customers is\\nconstantly being expanded and updated. Compared to\\n\\n172\\n\\nthe assumptions made in the outlook, the BMW Group\\ndoes not expect these opportunities to have a significant\\nearnings impact over the two-year assessment period.\\n\\nFINANCIAL RISKS AND RISKS RELATING TO THE\\nUSE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\\n\\nCurrency risks and opportunities\\nAs an internationally operating enterprise, the\\nBMW Group conducts business in a variety of currencies,\\nthus giving rise to currency risks and opportunities. A\\nsubstantial portion of Group revenues, purchasing and\\nfunding occur outside the eurozone, particularly in China\\nand the USA. Regularly updated cash-flow-at-risk models\\nand scenario analyses are used to measure currency risks\\nand opportunities. If currency risks were to materialise,\\nthey could be associated with a high earnings impact over\\nthe two-year assessment period. The risk amount relating\\nto currency risks is classified as high. The risk assessment\\nis therefore slightly less favourable than one year earlier,\\ndue to the increased volatility of individual currencies\\nin the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Significant\\nopportunities can arise if currency developments are\\nfavourable for the BMW Group.\\nOperational currency management is based on the results of currency risk analyses. The BMW Group manages\\ncurrency risks at both strategic (medium to longterm)\\nand operational level (short to mediumterm). Medium- to\\nlong-term measures include increasing production and\\npurchase volumes in foreign currency regions, i. e. natural hedging. Currency risks are managed in the short\\n\\nto medium term and for operational purposes by means\\nof hedging on financial markets. The principal objective\\nis to increase planning reliability for the BMW Group.\\nHedging transactions are entered into only with financial partners of good credit standing. Opportunities are\\nalso secured through the use of options during specific\\nmarket phases.\\nRisks and opportunities relating to raw materials prices\\nAs a large-scale manufacturing company, the\\nBMW Group is exposed to purchase price risks, particularly in relation to the raw materials used in vehicle\\nproduction. The analysis of raw materials price risks is\\nbased on planned purchases of raw materials and components containing those products. Cash-flow-at-risk\\nmodels and scenario analyses are used to measure risks\\nand opportunities relating to raw materials prices.\\nIf such risks were to materialise, they could have a\\nmedium earnings impact over the two-year assessment\\nperiod. The risk amount is classified as medium. Significant opportunities could arise if raw materials prices\\ndevelop favourably for the BMW Group.\\nChanges in prices are monitored via a well-defined\\nmanagement process, the primary objective of which is\\nto increase planning reliability for the BMW Group. Price\\nfluctuations for precious metals (platinum, palladium,\\nrhodium), nonferrous metals (aluminium, copper), raw\\nmaterials for batteries (lead, nickel, cobalt) and, to some\\nextent, for steel and its basic ingredients (iron ore, coking\\ncoal) as well as energy (gas, electricity) are hedged using\\nfinancial derivatives and supply contracts with fixed\\npricing arrangements.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport on Outlook, Risks and Opportunities\\n\\nLiquidity risks\\nThe major part of the Financial Services segment’s\\ncredit financing and leasing business is refinanced on\\ncapital markets. Liquidity risks can arise in the form\\nof rising refinancing costs or from restricted access to\\nfunds as a consequence of the general market situation. If\\nliquidity risks were to materialise, they would be likely to\\nhave a medium earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. The risk amount associated with liquidity\\nrisks, including the risk of the BMW Group’s rating being\\ndowngraded, is classified as medium. The year-on-year\\nchange in the assessment of the risk amount reflects\\nthe sharp short-term rise in refinancing costs on capital\\nmarkets at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.\\nBased on the experience gained during the global\\nfinancial crisis, a liquidity concept has been drawn up,\\nwhich is rigorously adhered to and continuously developed. The concept has been recently updated to take\\naccount of the implications of the coronavirus pandemic.\\nThe use of the “matched funding principle” to finance\\nthe Financial Services segment’s operations ensures\\nthat liquidity risks are generally avoided. Furthermore,\\nscenarios have been calculated to present and analyse\\nthe potential impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the\\nmatched funding principle.\\nSolvency is assured at all times throughout the\\nBMW Group by adhering to liquidity ratios and using a\\nbroadly diversified range of refinancing sources. Regular\\nmeasurement and monitoring ensure that cash inflows\\nand outflows for the various maturities and currencies\\noffset one another. This approach is an integral part of\\nthe BMW Group’s liquidity concept.\\n\\n173\\n\\nThe liquidity position is monitored continuously and\\nmanaged through the Group-wide planning of financial\\nrequirements and funding. The diversified refinancing\\nstrategy employed reduces dependency on financial\\ninstruments and markets. Moreover, the BMW Group’s\\nsolid financial and earnings position results in high credit\\nratings from internationally recognised rating agencies.\\nAt present, opportunities relating to liquidity are not\\nexpected to have any significant earnings impact.\\nFurther information on risks in conjunction with financial instruments is provided in note 39 to the Group\\nFinancial Statements.\\nOther financial risks\\nOther financial risks worth mentioning include counterparty risks as well as those arising in connection with\\ninvestments in other entities.\\nThe BMW Group works together with banks to ensure that the available liquidity is optimally invested and\\nto hedge against financial market risks (particularly currency, commodity and interest rate risks) using derivative\\nfinancial instruments. Counterparty risk describes the\\nrisk that the BMW Group will not receive the payments\\ndue to it in connection with the investment and hedging\\ntransactions referred to above. An enhanced value-at-risk\\nmodel is employed to measure counterparty risk, taking\\ninto account the creditworthiness (rating) of the banks\\nand the business volumes involved. Risk is managed\\nusing a limit system, which includes daily monitoring of\\nthe extent to which limits are being utilised.\\n\\nThe BMW Group holds equity investments of varying\\namounts in numerous entities, which could result in risk\\nfrom depreciation and amortisation.\\nIf other financial risks were to materialise, they could\\nhave a medium earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. The risk amount associated with other\\nfinancial risks is classified as medium. Revaluations\\nof investments could give rise to opportunities with a\\nsignificant earnings impact.\\nRisks and opportunities relating to pension obligations\\nFuture pension obligations are financed largely via\\nexternal pension funds or trust constructs that are legally separate from BMW. Externally managed funds are\\ninvested on capital markets in a broadly diversified portfolio with a view to enabling future pension payments to\\nbe disbursed out of pension assets. These arrangements\\ngreatly reduce the need to fund pension payments out\\nof ongoing operations.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport on Outlook, Risks and Opportunities\\n\\nRisks arise from fluctuations in pension obligations\\non the one hand and the related pension assets on the\\nother. Opportunities arise if the value of pension assets\\non capital markets develops favourably or if pension\\nobligations decrease at a more pronounced rate than\\nthe related assets.\\nPension obligations are primarily measured using a\\ndiscount rate based on market yields from high-quality\\ncorporate bonds. These yields are subject to market\\nfluctuations and therefore influence the level of pension\\nobligations. Changes in other parameters, such as rising\\ninflation rates and longer life expectancy, also impact\\nthe amount as well as the duration of future pension\\npayments. Regulatory requirements or changes may also\\naffect the amount of pension obligations.\\nThe fluctuation of pension assets reflects the volatility of individual asset classes on capital markets. The\\nbroadly diversified portfolio comprises investments in\\ninterest-bearing securities, equities, real estate and other\\nasset classes.\\nDespite the high level of external funding, risks relating to pension obligations could have a high earnings\\nimpact over the two-year assessment period. The risk\\namounts attached to pension obligations are classified as\\nhigh. The strategic portfolio allocation of pension assets\\ntherefore comprises two key components. One part is allocated with a view to hedging against value fluctuations,\\napplying the “liability-driven investment approach”,\\nwhereby capital market instruments are employed on\\na targeted basis to hedge against financial risks arising\\nfrom the measurement of pension obligations. A second\\npart is allocated with a view to generating income. Within\\na favourable capital market environment, this part of the\\n\\n174\\n\\npension assets offers the opportunity to further reduce\\npension plan deficits by generating positive returns and\\nthereby impact the BMW Group’s financial position to a\\nsignificant degree. The risks and opportunities described\\nabove are continuously monitored and managed.\\nRemeasurements on the liability and asset sides are\\nrecognised net of deferred taxes through other comprehensive income and hence directly in equity (within\\nrevenue reserves).\\nFurther information on risks in conjunction with\\npension provisions is provided in note 32 to the Group\\nFinancial Statements.\\n\\nLEGAL RISKS\\n\\nThe BMW Group is exposed to various legal risks,\\nnot least due to the global nature of its operations. Legal\\nrisks may result from non-compliance with laws or other\\nlegal requirements or from legal disputes with business\\npartners or other market participants. If legal risks were\\nto materialise, they could have a high earnings impact\\nover the two-year assessment period. The risk amounts\\nattached to significant identified legal risks are classified\\nas medium. However, it cannot be ruled out that new\\nlegal risks, as yet unforeseen, materialise that could have\\na high earnings impact for the BMW Group.\\nThe growing globalisation of the BMW Group’s\\noperations as well as of business interdependencies\\nin general, combined with the variety and complexity\\nof legal provisions – increasingly including import\\n\\nand export regulations – give rise to a greater risk of\\nnon-compliance with applicable law. A Compliance Management System is in place across the BMW Group to\\nensure that its representative bodies, executives and staff\\nmembers worldwide consistently act in a lawful manner.\\nIn 2020, the system was further developed, primarily by\\nestablishing additional compliance functions in various\\ncentralised departments within BMW AG, stepping up\\nface-to-face training on antitrust compliance and via a\\nGroup-wide “Tone from the Top” communication initiative that reflects the compliance management culture\\nwithin the BMW Group. Corporate Governance\\nLike all entities with international operations, the\\nBMW Group is confronted with legal disputes, alleged\\nclaims (particularly relating to warranties and product\\nliability or intellectual property rights infringements)\\nand proceedings initiated by government agencies. Any\\nof these could, amongst other consequences, have an\\nadverse impact on the Group’s reputation. Such proceedings are typical for the sector, may result as a consequence of realigning product or purchasing strategies\\nto changed market conditions or are antitrust-related.\\nParticularly in the US market, class action lawsuits and\\nproduct liability risks can have substantial financial consequences and cause damage to the Group’s reputation.\\nMore rigorous application or interpretation of existing\\nregulations or the introduction of new regulations could\\nresult in a greater number of recalls.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport on Outlook, Risks and Opportunities\\n\\nIn an antitrust investigation, the EU Commission alleges that five German car manufacturers colluded with\\nthe aim of restricting competition for innovation with\\nregard to certain exhaust treatment systems for dieseland petrol-driven passenger vehicles. The current investigation is solely concerned with possible infringements of\\ncompetition law. The EU Commission is not alleging that\\nthe BMW Group conducted a deliberate and unlawful manipulation of the emissions control system. The Statement\\nof Objections leads the BMW Group to believe that it is\\nprobable (“more likely than not”) that the Commission\\nwill issue a significant fine. A provision of approximately\\n€ 1.4 billion was recognised in 2019 in accordance with\\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards for negative\\nfinancial impacts that cannot yet be definitively assessed.\\nIn December 2019 the BMW Group submitted a detailed\\nreply to the Statement of Objections. The EU Commission is currently examining the reply and, on that basis,\\nwill determine the next procedural steps. Therefore, the\\nfinancial impact cannot yet be definitively assessed.\\nFor several years, lawsuits have been filed against\\nBMW Bank GmbH (BMW Bank) in which consumers\\nclaim the withdrawal of their loan and leasing contracts\\non the basis of allegedly incorrect and insufficient\\npre-contractual information. The focus is on loan contracts. Since 2017, BMW Bank has won the vast majority\\nof these lawsuits. In November 2019, the Federal Court\\nof Justice (BGH) adopted a decision of principle in favour\\nof BMW Bank, confirming the accuracy of consumer-relevant information in loan contracts. In addition, in October 2020 the BGH decided in a case in which BMW Bank\\n\\n175\\n\\nwas not involved that consumers are generally obliged to\\npay a compensation after a successful withdrawal. Since\\nthe beginning of 2020, several references for a preliminary ruling on the scope of information obligations\\nhave been filed with the European Court of Justice (ECJ).\\nOn the basis of these requests, there is a risk that BMW\\nBank’s prospects of success in the withdrawal lawsuits\\ncould deteriorate in the event of negative future ECJ case\\nlaw. The possible financial impact cannot be definitively\\nassessed at this stage.\\nThe BMW Group recognises appropriate levels of provision for lawsuits. In addition, a part of these risks is insured to an economically reasonable extent. Further risks\\nfrom legal proceedings are reported as other contingent\\nliabilities. It cannot be ruled out, however, that damages\\narise that are either not covered or not fully covered by\\ninsurance policies or provisions or reported as contingent\\nliabilities. In accordance with IAS 37 (Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets), the required\\ninformation is not provided if the BMW Group concludes\\nthat its disclosure could seriously prejudice the outcome\\nof the relevant legal proceedings. Further information on\\ncontingent liabilities is provided in note 38 to the Group\\nFinancial Statements.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport on Outlook, Risks and Opportunities\\n\\nRISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN THE\\nFINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT\\n\\nIn the Financial Services segment, the risk management process also takes financial regulatory requirements such as Basel III into account. Internal methods\\nfor identifying, measuring, managing and monitoring\\nrisks within the Financial Services segment comply with\\nnational and international standards. Risk management\\nwithin the Financial Services business is built on the\\nprevailing risk culture, the defined risk strategy, the\\ninternal capital adequacy assessment process framework\\nand a set of rules comprising principles and guidelines.\\nIn organisational terms, the risk management process\\nis ensured by means of a clear division between frontand back-office activities and a comprehensive internal\\ncontrol system. The main tool used to manage risk\\nwithin the Financial Services segment is to ensure the\\nsegment’s risk-bearing capacity.\\nAll risks – in the sense of unexpected losses – must\\nbe covered at all times. Based on the entity’s risk appetite, this is achieved by ensuring specified levels of\\nrisk-covering assets (asset cushions) in the form of equity\\ncapital. Unexpected losses are measured using various\\nvalue-at-risk models, which are validated at regular intervals. Risks are also aggregated after taking account of\\ncorrelation effects. In addition to assessing the Group’s\\nability to bear risk, stress scenarios are also examined.\\nThe segment’s risk-bearing capacity is also regularly\\nmonitored by means of an integrated limit system for\\nthe various risk categories.\\n\\n176\\n\\nSustainability has developed into a megatrend of\\nour time and is increasingly becoming the focus of\\npolitical and social debate. Both the effects of climate\\nchange and the changes brought about by the fight\\nagainst climate change are also likely to be reflected\\nacross the world’s financial system. Due to the potential\\nmacroeconomic consequences, the related sustainability\\nrisks are seen as a threat to the stability of financial\\nmarkets. In the context of bank supervision at national\\nand international level, it is therefore essential that the\\nbanks concerned take sustainability risks adequately\\ninto account.\\nThe Financial Services segment not only helps its\\ncustomers to satisfy their mobility needs by offering\\ncredit financing and leasing products, it also promotes\\nthe BMW Group’s industrial business from a sales point\\nof view. The far-reaching consequences of the debate\\non sustainability and sustainability risks affect both the\\nnon-financial economy (and therefore the BMW Group)\\nand the financial economy (and therefore the Financial\\nServices segment). Due to the close interrelationships\\n\\nwithin the Group, developments that affect the\\nBMW Group’s industrial business in the first step (e. g.\\ndiesel driving bans, adjustments to carbon emissions\\ntargets, the growing proportion of e-vehicles, etc.) are\\nalso relevant for the Financial Services segment in the\\nsecond step. This environment has always been part\\nof the underlying framework of the Financial Services\\nsegment’s business model.\\nThe growing challenges posed by climate change\\nand the resulting impact on the financial system are\\ntaken into account in the Financial Services segment by\\nadequately addressing sustainability risks. As an integral part of the BMW Group’s value chain, the Financial\\nServices segment is highly aware of the importance of\\nmanaging sustainability risks and is therefore fully integrated in the BMW Group’s comprehensive sustainable\\ncorporate strategy.\\nThe following overview provides a general summary\\nof the main risks and opportunities in the Financial\\nServices segment:\\nRisks\\n\\nOpportunities\\n\\nClassification of\\nrisk amount\\n\\nChange compared\\nto prior year\\n\\nClassification\\n\\nChange compared\\nto prior year\\n\\nMedium\\n\\nStable\\n\\nInsignificant\\n\\nStable\\n\\nHigh\\n\\nStable\\n\\nSignificant\\n\\nStable\\n\\nInterest rate changes\\n\\nMedium\\n\\nStable\\n\\nSignificant\\n\\nStable\\n\\nOperational risks\\n\\nMedium\\n\\nStable\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\nRISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\\nRisks and opportunities relating to the provision of financial services\\nCredit risk\\nResidual value\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport on Outlook, Risks and Opportunities\\n\\nRisks and opportunities relating to the Financial Services\\nsegment\\nThe main categories of risk relevant for the Financial Services segment are credit and counterparty risk,\\nresidual value risk, interest rate risk, operational risk\\nand liquidity risk. The evaluation of liquidity risk for the\\nFinancial Services segment is included in the liquidity\\nrisk category for the Group as a whole.\\nDuring the financial year 2020, the aggregate risk\\ncushion for risks in the Financial Services segment was\\nsufficient at all times, thereby ensuring the segment’s\\nrisk-bearing capacity.\\nCredit and counterparty risks and opportunities relating\\nto the Financial Services segment\\nCredit and counterparty default risk arises within\\nthe Financial Services segment if a contractual partner\\n(e. g. a customer or dealership) becomes either unable or\\nonly partially able to fulfil its contractual obligations, so\\nthat lower income is generated or losses are incurred. If\\nunexpected credit and counterparty default risks were to\\nmaterialise, they could have a medium earnings impact\\nover the two-year assessment period. The risk amount is\\nclassified as medium. The BMW Group classifies potential opportunities in this area as insignificant.\\nIn light of the uncertainties surrounding the future\\ncourse of the coronavirus pandemic, additional credit\\nloss provisions were recognised during the financial year\\n2020 for expected credit losses, in order to reflect the\\npossible negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on\\nretail customer and dealership business for accounting\\npurposes.\\n\\n177\\n\\nInitial and continuous creditworthiness testing is an\\nimportant aspect of the BMW Group’s credit risk management system. For this reason, every borrower’s creditworthiness is tested for all credit financing and leasing\\ncontracts entered into by the BMW Group. Opportunities\\nmay arise if the managed portfolio performs better over\\ntime than estimated when the credits were granted. The\\nintensive management of purchasing processes and collateral assessment as well as favourable macroeconomic\\ndevelopments could accentuate these opportunities. In\\nthe case of retail customer financing, creditworthiness\\nis assessed using validated scoring systems integrated in\\nthe purchasing process. In the area of dealership financing, creditworthiness is assessed by means of ongoing\\ncredit monitoring and an internal rating system that\\ntakes account not only of the material credit standing of\\nthe borrower, but also of qualitative factors such as past\\nreliability in business relationships. Changes in the creditworthiness of customers arising during the credit term\\nare covered by risk provisioning procedures. The credit\\nrisk of individual customers is quantified on a monthly\\nbasis and, depending on the outcome, taken into account\\nwithin the risk provisioning system. Macroeconomic\\ndevelopments are currently subject to a higher degree\\nof volatility. If developments are more favourable than\\nassumed in the outlook, credit losses may be reduced,\\nleading to a positive earnings impact.\\nDue to the coronavirus pandemic, moratoria were\\ngranted to customers and dealers, particularly during\\nthe first six months of the year, taking into account the\\nprevailing legal requirements. The simultaneous improvement in the economic situation in most markets in\\nthe second half of the year meant that the low percentage\\nof actual loan defaults was kept stable.\\n\\nResidual value risks and opportunities relating to the\\nFinancial Services segment\\nRisks and opportunities arise in conjunction with\\nleasing contracts if the market value of a leased vehicle\\nat the end of the contractual term of a lease differs from\\nthe residual value estimated at the commencement date\\nof the lease. A residual value risk exists if the expected\\nmarket value of the vehicle at the end of the contractual\\nterm is lower than its estimated residual value at the date\\nthe contract is entered into. If unexpected residual value\\nrisks were to materialise, they could have a high earnings\\nimpact from the Group’s perspective over the two-year\\nassessment period. A high earnings impact would then\\narise for the affected Financial Services and Automotive\\nsegments. The risk amount is classified as high for the\\nGroup as a whole. Opportunities can arise out of a positive deviation between the actual market value and the\\noriginal residual value forecast. The BMW Group classifies potential residual value opportunities as significant.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nReport on Outlook, Risks and Opportunities\\n\\nEach vehicle’s estimated residual value is calculated\\non the basis of historical external and internal data. This\\nestimation provides the expected market value of the vehicle at the end of the contractual period. Developments\\non pre-owned car markets are an important factor for the\\nBMW Group. In 2020, the number of electrified vehicles\\nalso continued to increase. Changes in the value of these\\nvehicles are largely determined by a set of known influencing factors. Prices on pre-owned car markets in the\\npremium segment fluctuated within the usual range and\\nwere even favourably influenced in some cases by coronavirus-related catch-up effects. As part of the management of residual value risks, the net present value of risk\\ncosts is also calculated at the contract commencement\\ndate. Market developments are monitored throughout\\nthe contractual period and the risk assessment updated\\naccordingly. Residual value risk management essentially\\nfollows the same established process, regardless of the\\ndrivetrain variant.\\nBased on current expectations of a rising level of residual value losses in subsequent years, the level of risk\\nprovisioning has been raised in the form of additional\\nprovisions and in line with applicable financial reporting\\nstandards. Accordingly, risk costs for residual value risks\\nin the Financial Services segment are significantly higher\\nthan one year earlier.\\n\\n178\\n\\nInterest rate risks and opportunities relating to the\\nFinancial Services segment\\nInterest rate risks in the Financial Services segment\\nrelate to potential losses caused by changes in market\\ninterest rates. These can arise when fixed interest rate\\nperiods do not match for assets and liabilities recognised\\nin the balance sheet. If interest rate risks were to materialise, they could have a medium earnings impact over\\nthe two-year assessment period. The risk amount is classified as medium. Favourable interest rate developments\\ncompared to the outlook represent opportunities that\\nthe BMW Group classifies as significant. Interest rate\\nrisks in the Financial Services business are managed by\\nensuring that fixed interest rate periods match to a large\\nextent and through the use of interest-rate derivatives. If\\nthe relevant recognition criteria are fulfilled, derivatives\\nused by the BMW Group are accounted for as hedging\\nrelationships. Further information on risks in conjunction with financial instruments is provided in note 39 to\\nthe Group Financial Statements.\\n\\nOperational risks relating to the\\nFinancial Services segment\\nIn the Financial Services segment, operational risks\\nare defined as the risk of losses arising as a consequence\\nof the unsuitability or failure of internal procedures\\n(process risks), people (personnel-related risks), systems\\n(infrastructure- and IT-related risks) and external events\\n(external risks). The recording and measurement of risk\\nscenarios, loss events and countermeasures in the operational risk management system provide the basis for\\nthe systematic analysis and management of potential or\\nmaterialised operational risks. Annual self-assessments\\nare also carried out. This risk category also includes\\nsustainability risks that correspond to the definition of\\noperational risks, such as external events or natural and\\nman-made disasters.\\nIf operational risks were to materialise, they would be\\nlikely to have a low earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. The risk amount is classified as medium.\\nAt present, no significant opportunities for the earnings\\nsituation are seen with regard to operational risks.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nInternal Control System Relevant for Accounting and Financial Reporting Processes\\n\\nINTERNAL CONTROL\\nSYSTEM * RELEVANT\\nFOR ACCOUNTING AND\\nFINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESSES\\nThe internal control system relevant for accounting\\nand financial reporting processes has the task of ensuring that accounting and financial reporting of the\\nBMW Group is both accurate and reliable. Within the\\nframework of the “Three Lines of Defence” model used\\nto manage risk across the Group, the internal control\\nsystem represents a key component of the second line\\nof defence, serving as a link between the operating units,\\nthe corporate audit function and the external auditors.\\nInternationally recognised standards for internal\\ncontrol systems were taken into account when designing\\nthe various components of the BMW Group’s internal\\ncontrol system. The system comprises:\\n\\n— Group-wide mandatory accounting guidelines\\n— Controls integrated in processes and IT systems\\n\\n* Disclosures pursuant to sections 289 and 315 HGB.\\n\\n179\\n\\n— Organisational measures incorporating the principles\\nof the risk-oriented segregation of duties\\n\\n— Process-independent monitoring measures\\nThe system and the methodologies applied are subject to continuous improvement, with system effectiveness assessed regularly on the basis of centralised and\\ndecentralised process analyses, analyses of data within\\nthe various financial systems and audit procedures. The\\nprincipal features of the internal control system, as far\\nas they relate to individual entity and Group accounting\\nand financial reporting processes, are described below.\\nGuidelines for recognising, measuring and allocating\\nitems to accounts are available to all Group employees\\nvia the intranet. New accounting standards are assessed\\nfor their impact on the BMW Group’s accounting and\\nfinancial reporting. Accounting guidelines and processes\\nare reviewed continuously and revised at least once a\\nyear, or more frequently if required.\\nPreventive and detective controls are integrated in\\nGroup accounting and financial reporting processes.\\nPreventive controls serve to prevent errors and omissions, whereas detective controls serve to detect and\\ncorrect errors. To the extent possible, they are designed\\nto comply with the principle of the segregation of duties.\\nKey IT systems that are relevant for accounting and financial reporting incorporate controls designed, among\\nother things, to prevent business transactions from being\\nrecorded incorrectly as well as to ensure the timely recognition and measurement of all business transactions\\nin accordance with applicable requirements. Controls are\\nalso in place to test the appropriateness of consolidation\\nprocedures.\\n\\nIn conjunction with the ongoing development of\\nIT systems relevant for accounting and financial reporting processes at both individual entity and Group level,\\ncontrols are adapted to take account of new requirements\\nand opportunities arising as a result of advances in information technology. Moreover, the BMW Group uses data\\nanalysis tools to identify and subsequently eliminate any\\nweaknesses in the control system.\\nResponsibilities for ensuring the effectiveness of\\nthe internal control system in Group accounting and\\nfinancial reporting processes are clearly defined and\\nallocated to the relevant line and process managers.\\nThese managers report annually on their assessment\\nof the effectiveness of the internal control system for\\naccounting and financial reporting purposes. The assessment also includes the results of internal and external\\naudits as well as of data analysis that is conducted on a\\ncontinual basis. In this context, the Group’s various units\\nconfirm the effectiveness of the internal control system\\nfor accounting and financial reporting. The results of\\nthe assessment are gathered and documented with the\\naid of appropriate tools. Any weaknesses in the control\\nsystem are eliminated, taking into account their potential\\nimpact on accounting and financial reporting processes.\\nThe Board of Management and the Audit Committee\\nare briefed annually on the effectiveness of the internal\\ncontrol system for accounting and financial reporting.\\nThe Board of Management and, where appropriate, the\\nSupervisory Board, are informed without delay if there\\nare any significant changes in the effectiveness of the\\ninternal control system.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCombined Management Report\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nDisclosures Relevant for Takeovers and Explanatory Comments\\n\\nDISCLOSURES\\nRELEVANT FOR\\nTAKEOVERS* AND\\nEXPLANATORY\\nCOMMENTS\\nCOMPOSITION OF SUBSCRIBED CAPITAL\\n\\nThe subscribed capital (share capital) of BMW AG\\namounted to € 659,684,500 at 31 December 2020 (2019:\\n€ 658,862,500) and, in accordance with Article 4 no. 1\\nof the Articles of Incorporation is sub-divided into\\n601,995,196 shares of common stock (91.26 %) (2019:\\n601,995,196': None, ' 91.37 %) and 57,689,304 shares of non-voting preferred stock (8.74 %) (2019: 56,867,304': None, ' 8.63 %),\\neach with a par value of € 1.

Group\\n\\nGroup Financial Statements\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\\n\\nNOTES TO THE\\nGROUP FINANCIAL\\nSTATEMENTS\\nAccounting Principles\\nand Policies\\n\\n01 BASIS OF PREPARATION\\n\\nThe consolidated financial statements of Bayerische\\nMotoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW Group Financial\\nStatements or Group Financial Statements) at 31 December 2020 were drawn up in accordance with International\\nFinancial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as endorsed by the\\nEuropean Union (EU), and the supplementary requirements of § 315 e (1) of the German Commercial Code\\n(HGB). The Group Financial Statements and Combined\\nManagement Report will be submitted electronically to\\nthe operator of the Federal Gazette and are accessible\\nvia the website of the Company Register. Bayerische\\nMotoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW AG), which\\nhas its seat in Germany, Munich, Petuelring 130, is\\nregistered in the Commercial Register of the District\\nCourt of Munich under the number HRB 42243.\\nBMW AG manufactures automobiles and motorcycles\\nin the premium segment.\\n\\n194\\n\\nThe Group currency is the euro. All amounts are\\ndisclosed in millions of euros (€ million) unless stated\\notherwise.\\nKey figures presented in the report have been rounded in accordance with standard commercial practise. In\\ncertain cases, this may mean that values do not add up\\nexactly to the stated total and that percentages cannot\\nbe derived from the values shown.\\nThe income statement for the BMW Group and\\nsegments is presented using the cost of sales method.\\nIn order to provide a better insight into the results\\nof operations, financial position and net assets of the\\nBMW Group, and going beyond the requirements of\\nIFRS 8 (Operating Segments), the Group Financial\\nStatements also include an income statement and a\\nbalance sheet for the Automotive, Motorcycles, Financial Services and Other Entities segments. The Group\\nCash Flow Statement is supplemented by a statement\\nof cash flows for the Automotive and Financial Services\\nsegments. Inter-segment transactions relate primarily\\nto internal sales of products, the provision of funds for\\nGroup companies and the related interest. A description\\nof the nature of the business and the major operating\\nactivities of the BMW Group’s segments is provided in\\nnote 45 (“Explanatory notes to segment information”).\\nApproval for the publication of the Group Financial\\nStatements was granted by the Board of Management\\non 9 March 2021 and by the Supervisory Board on\\n11 March 2021.\\nThe presentation of selected items was changed in\\nthe financial year 2020, whereby the changes were not\\nmaterial overall. Attention is drawn to the changes in\\n\\npresentation in the notes relating to relevant balance\\nsheet and income statement items. Prior year figures\\nhave been adjusted accordingly.\\n\\n02 GROUP REPORTING ENTITY AND\\nCONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES\\n\\nThe BMW Group Financial Statements include\\nBMW AG and all material subsidiaries over which\\nBMW AG – either directly or indirectly – exercises control. This also includes 57 structured entities, consisting\\nof asset-backed financing arrangements and special\\npurpose funds.\\nIn relation to fully consolidated companies, the following changes took place in the Group reporting entity\\nin the financial year 2020:\\nGermany\\n\\nForeign\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n21\\n\\n186\\n\\n207\\n\\nIncluded for the\\nfirst time in 2020\\n\\n–\\n\\n14\\n\\n14\\n\\nNo longer included\\nin 2020\\n\\n–\\n\\n15\\n\\n15\\n\\n21\\n\\n185\\n\\n206\\n\\nIncluded at\\n31 December 2019\\n\\nIncluded at\\n31 December 2020\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nGroup Financial Statements\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\\n\\nAll consolidated subsidiaries have the same year-end\\nas BMW AG with the exception of BMW India Private Ltd.\\nand BMW India Financial Services Private Ltd., whose\\nyear-ends are 31 March in accordance with local legal\\nrequirements.\\nWhen assessing whether an investment gives rise\\nto a controlled entity, an associated company, a joint\\noperation or a joint venture, the BMW Group considers\\ncontractual arrangements and other circumstances, as\\nwell as the structure and legal form of the entity. Discretionary decisions may also be required. If indications\\nexist of a change in the judgement of (joint) control, the\\nBMW Group undertakes a new assessment.\\nAn entity is deemed to be controlled if BMW AG – either directly or indirectly – has power over it, is exposed\\nor has rights to variable returns from it and has the\\nability to influence those returns.\\nAn entity is classified as an associated company if\\nBMW AG – either directly or indirectly – has the ability to\\nexercise significant influence over the entity’s operating\\nand financial policies. As a general rule, the Group is\\nassumed to have significant influence if it holds 20 % or\\nmore of the entity’s voting power.\\nJoint operations and joint ventures are forms of\\njoint arrangements. Such an arrangement exists when\\na BMW Group entity jointly carries out activities with a\\nthird party on the basis of a contractual agreement.\\nIn the case of a joint operation, the parties that have\\njoint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets\\nand obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of a joint\\noperation are recognised proportionately in the Group\\n\\n195\\n\\nFinancial Statements on the basis of the BMW Group\\nentity’s rights and obligations (proportionate consolidation).\\n\\nThe other changes to the Group reporting entity do\\nnot have a material impact on the results of operations,\\nfinancial position and net assets of the Group.\\n\\nThe two largest joint operations that are accounted\\nfor by the BMW Group and which are described below\\nare of minor significance for the Group Financial Statements as a whole:\\n\\n03 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\\nAND MEASUREMENT\\n\\n— The BMW Group is party to a cooperation with\\nToyota Motor Corporation, Toyota City, which has\\ndeveloped a sports car.\\n\\n— In 2019, the BMW Group and the Chinese automobile manufacturer Great Wall Motor Company\\nLimited (Great Wall) established the jointly operated\\ncompany, Spotlight Automotive Limited (Spotlight)\\nfor the future joint development and manufacture\\nof electric vehicles in China. The BMW Group and\\nGreat Wall each hold 50 % of the joint operation’s\\nequity. In addition to electric MINI vehicles, Spotlight will also develop and produce electric vehicles\\nfor Great Wall.\\n\\nIn June 2020, a joint decision was taken to temporarily put on hold the cooperation with the Daimler Group\\nfor the development of highly automated driving systems,\\nwhich is accounted for as a joint operation. This has no\\nimpact on the financial statements.\\nIn the case of a joint venture, the parties which have\\njoint control only have rights to the net assets of the\\narrangement.\\nAssociated companies and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, with measurement on\\ninitial recognition based on acquisition cost.\\n\\nThe financial statements of consolidated companies\\nwhich are presented in a foreign currency are translated using the modified closing rate method. Under\\nthis method, assets and liabilities are translated at the\\nclosing exchange rate, whilst income and expenses are\\ntrans lated at the average exchange rate. Differences\\narising on foreign currency translation are presented in\\n“Accumulated other equity“.\\nIn the single entity accounts of BMW AG and its subsidiaries, foreign currency receivables and payables are\\nmeasured on initial recognition using the exchange rate\\nprevailing at the date of first-time recognition. Advance\\npayments to suppliers or from customers in a foreign\\ncurrency that result in the addition of non-monetary\\nassets or liabilities are recorded at the exchange rate\\nprevailing at the date of payment. At the end of the\\nreporting period, foreign currency receivables and payables are measured using the closing exchange rate. The\\nresulting unrealised gains and losses, as well as realised\\ngains and losses arising on settlement, are recognised\\nin the income statement, in line with the underlying\\nsubstance of the transaction. Non-monetary balance\\nsheet items denominated in foreign currencies are rolled\\nforward on the basis of historical exchange rates.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nGroup Financial Statements\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\\n\\n196\\n\\nThe exchange rates of currencies which have a\\nmaterial impact on the Group Financial Statements were\\nas follows:\\nClosing rate\\n1 Euro ': 'Average rate\\n\\n31. 12. 2020\\n\\n31. 12. 2019\\n\\n2020\\n\\n2019\\n\\nUS-Dollar\\n\\n1.23\\n\\n1.12\\n\\n1.14\\n\\n1.12\\n\\nBritish Pound\\n\\n0.90\\n\\n0.85\\n\\n0.89\\n\\n0.88\\n\\nChinese Renminbi\\n\\n8.00\\n\\n7.82\\n\\n7.87\\n\\n7.73\\n\\nSouth African Rand\\n\\n17.97\\n\\n15.72\\n\\n18.77\\n\\n16.17\\n\\nRussian Rouble\\n\\n90.54\\n\\n69.60\\n\\n82.71\\n\\n72.43\\n\\nArgentina has fulfilled the definition of a hyperinflationary economy since 1 July 2018. Since that\\ndate, IAS 29 (Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary\\nEconomies) has therefore been applied for the BMW\\nsubsidiary in Argentina. The price indices published\\nby the Federación Argentina de Consejos Profesionales\\nde Ciencias Económicas (FACPCE) are used to adjust\\nnon-monetary assets and liabilities and items in the\\nincome statement. The resulting effects are not material\\nfor the BMW Group.\\n\\n04 FINANCIAL REPORTING RULES\\n\\nFinancial reporting standards applied for\\nthe first time in the financial year 2020\\nStandards or amendments to standards applied\\nfor the first time in the financial year do not have any\\nsignificant impact on the BMW Group Financial Statements.\\na\\n\\nFinancial reporting standards issued by\\nthe IASB, but not yet applied\\nIn August 2020, the IASB published the Amendment\\nStandard Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (IBOR) –\\nPhase 2. The amendments contain a number of reliefs to\\nmitigate the impact on the accounting treatment of hedge\\nrelationships, financial instruments and lease liabilities\\nresulting from the reform of interest rate benchmarks.\\nb\\n\\nIn accordance with the amendments, hedge accounting is not required to be discontinued solely because of\\nthe reform. Instead, the hedge relationships are deemed\\nto remain in place even if the existing benchmark interest\\nrate is replaced by an alternative interest rate, provided\\nthat the underlying documentation has been appropriately updated.\\nReplacing a previous benchmark rate results in a\\nchange in the basis for determining the contractual cash\\nflows relating to financial assets and financial liabilities.\\nFor simplification purposes, it is permitted to account for\\nthe change by updating the effective interest rate without\\nany immediate impact on profit or loss. This practical\\nexpedient is also available for finance leases, in that\\nthe requirements contained in IFRS 9 for modifications\\nare deemed to apply. A similar practical expedient is\\navailable for lease liabilities accounted for in accordance\\nwith IFRS 16. In this case, any modification required by\\nthe benchmark reform results only in the lease liability\\nbeing remeasured when the alternative interest rate is\\nused to discount the modified lease payments.\\nThe amendments are mandatory for financial years\\nbeginning on or after 1 January 2021. The BMW Group\\nintends to apply the proposed practical expedients\\nfor transactions affected by the benchmark reform. The\\namendments have not been adopted early for the financial year 2020.\\nOther financial reporting standards issued by the\\nIASB and not yet applied are not expected to have\\nany significant impact on the BMW Group Financial\\nStatements.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nGroup Financial Statements\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\\n\\n05 ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ASSUMPTIONS,\\nJUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATIONS\\n\\nRevenues from customer contracts include in particular revenues from the sale of products (primarily new\\nand pre-owned vehicles and related products) as well\\nas revenues from services. Revenue is recognised when\\ncontrol is transferred to the dealership or retail customer.\\nIn the case of sales of products, this is usually at the\\npoint in time when the risks and rewards of ownership\\nare transferred. Revenues are stated net of settlement\\ndiscount, bonuses and rebates as well as interest and\\nresidual value subsidies. The consideration arising from\\nthese sales usually falls due for payment immediately or\\nwithin 30 days. In exceptional cases, a longer payment\\nmay also be agreed. In the case of services, control is\\ntransferred over time. Consideration for the rendering\\nof services to customers usually falls due for payment\\nat the beginning of a contract and is therefore deferred\\nas a contract liability. The deferred amount is released\\nover the service period and recognised as revenue in\\nthe income statement. As a rule, amounts are released\\non the basis of the expected expense trend, as this best\\nreflects the performance of the service. If the sale of\\nproducts includes a determinable amount for services\\n(multiple-component contracts), the related revenues\\nare deferred and recognised as income in the same way.\\nVariable consideration components, such as bonuses,\\nare measured at the expected value, and in the case of\\nmulti-component contracts, allocated to all performance\\nobligations unless directly attributable to the sale of a\\nvehicle.\\n\\n197\\n\\nRevenues from the sale of products, for which repurchase arrangements are in place, are not recognised\\nimmediately in full. Instead, revenues are either recognised proportionately or the difference between the\\nsales and repurchase price recognised in instalments over\\nthe term of the contract depending on the nature of the\\nagreement. In the case of vehicles sold to a dealership\\nthat are expected to be repurchased in a subsequent\\nperiod as part of leasing operations, revenues are not\\nrecognised at Group level at the time of the sale of the\\nvehicle. Instead, assets and liabilities relating to the right\\nof return vehicles are recognised.\\nRevenues from leases of own-manufactured vehicles\\nare recognised at Group level in accordance with the requirements for manufacturer or dealer leases. In the case\\nof operating leases, revenues from lease payments are\\nrecognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In\\nthe case of finance leases, revenues are recognised at the\\nlease commencement date at the amount of the fair value\\nof the leased asset and reduced by any unguaranteed\\nresidual value of vehicles that are expected to be returned\\nto the Group at the end of the lease term. Similarly, cost\\nof sales is reduced for unguaranteed residual values. In\\naddition, initial direct costs are recognised as cost of sales\\nat the lease commencement date.\\nRevenues also include interest income from financial\\nservices. Interest income arising on finance leases as well\\nas on retail customer and dealership financing is recognised using the effective interest method and reported\\nas interest income on credit financing within revenues.\\n\\nPublic sector grants are not recognised until there is\\nreasonable assurance that the conditions attaching to\\nthem have been complied with and the grants will be\\nreceived. The resulting income is recognised in cost of\\nsales over the periods in which the costs occur that they\\nare intended to compensate.\\nEarnings per share are calculated as follows: Basic\\nearnings per share are calculated for common and preferred stock by dividing the net profit for the year after\\nminority interests and attributable to each category of\\nstock, by the average number of outstanding shares. Net\\nprofit for the year is accordingly allocated to the different\\ncategories of stock. The portion of the net profit that\\nis not being distributed is allocated to each category of\\nstock based on the number of outstanding shares. Profits\\navailable for distribution are determined directly on the\\nbasis of the dividend proposals or resolutions for common and preferred stock. Diluted earnings per share are\\ncalculated and separately disclosed in accordance with\\nIAS 33.\\nIntangible assets are measured at acquisition or manufacturing cost. Intangible assets with finite useful lives\\nare amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful\\nlives of between three and 20 years. Impairment losses\\nare recognised where necessary. Intangible assets with\\nindefinite useful lives are tested annually for impairment.\\nInternally generated intangible assets mainly comprise\\ndevelopment costs for vehicle, module and architecture\\nprojects.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nGroup Financial Statements\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\\n\\nDevelopment costs are capitalised if all of the criteria\\nspecified by IAS 38 are met. They are measured on the\\nbasis of direct costs and directly attributable overhead\\ncosts. Project-related capitalised development costs are\\namortised on a straight-line basis following the start of\\nproduction over the estimated product life (usually seven\\nto twelve years).\\nGoodwill arises on first-time consolidation of an\\nacquired business when the cost of acquisition exceeds\\nthe Group’s share of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities identified during the\\nacquisition.\\nIntangible assets also include emission allowances and\\nsimilar rights arising from programmes aimed at reducing\\ncarbon or other climate-damaging emissions (for example\\nin conjunction with the EU Emissions Trading System\\nor vehicle-related emissions regulations in the USA or\\nChina). These allowances and rights are carried at cost\\nand, in the event that they are allocated free of charge,\\nrecorded at a value of zero. Amounts are derecognised\\nat the date of the return, sale or expiry of the allowances\\nor rights. In parallel to the recognition of these allowances and rights as assets, provisions are recognised in\\naccordance with IAS 37 corresponding to the amount\\nof obligations expected to arise in conjunction with the\\nrelated emission regulations. Provisions are measured\\non the basis of the expected value of the allowances or\\nrights that are to be returned.\\n\\n198\\n\\nIf there is any indication of impairment of intangible\\nassets, or if an annual impairment test is required (i. e.\\nintangible assets with an indefinite useful life, intangible\\nassets during the development phase and goodwill), an\\nimpairment test is performed. Each individual asset is\\ntested separately unless the cash flows generated by\\nthe asset are not sufficiently independent from the\\ncash flows generated by other assets or other groups of\\nassets. In these cases, impairment is tested at the level\\nof a cash-generating unit, which is the norm for the\\nBMW Group.\\nFor the purpose of the impairment test, the carrying\\namount of an asset (or a cash-generating unit) is compared with the recoverable amount. The first step of the\\nimpairment test is to determine the value in use. If the\\nvalue in use is lower than the carrying amount, the next\\nstep is to determine the fair value less costs to sell and\\ncompare the amount so determined with the asset’s carrying amount. If the fair value is lower than the carrying\\namount, an impairment loss is recognised, reducing the\\ncarrying amount to the higher of the asset’s value in use\\nor fair value less costs to sell.\\nIf the reason for a previously recognised impairment\\nloss no longer exists, the impairment loss is reversed up\\nto the level of the recoverable amount, but no higher\\nthan the amortised acquisition or manufacturing cost.\\nImpairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.\\n\\nAs part of the process of assessing recoverability, it\\nis generally necessary to apply estimations and assumptions – in particular regarding future cash inflows and\\noutflows and the length of the forecast period – which\\ncould differ from actual amounts. Actual amounts may\\ndiffer from the assumptions and estimations used if\\nbusiness conditions develop differently to expectations.\\nThe BMW Group determines the value in use on the\\nbasis of a present value computation. Cash flows used\\nfor this calculation are derived from long-term forecasts\\napproved by management. These long-term forecasts are\\nbased on detailed forecasts drawn up at an operational\\nlevel, covering a planning period of six years. For the\\npurposes of calculating cash flows beyond the planning\\nperiod, a perpetual annuity return is assumed which\\ndoes not take growth into account. Forecasting assumptions are continually adjusted to current information and\\nregularly compared with external sources. The assumptions used take account in particular of expectations of\\nthe profitability of the product portfolio, future market\\nshare development, macroeconomic developments (such\\nas currency, interest rate and raw materials prices) as well\\nas the legal environment and past experience.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nGroup Financial Statements\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\\n\\n199\\n\\nAmounts are discounted on the basis of a market-related cost of capital rate.

The carrying amount of items of depreciable\\nproperty, plant and equipment is written down according\\nto scheduled usage-based depreciation – as a general rule\\non a straight-line basis – over the useful lives of the assets.\\nDepreciation is recorded as an expense in the income\\nstatement.\\nThe following useful lives are applied throughout the\\nBMW Group:\\nin years\\n\\nThe risk-adjusted discount rate, calculated using a\\nCAPM model, also takes into account specific peer-group\\ninformation relating to beta-factors, capital structure data\\nand borrowing costs. In conjunction with the impairment\\ntests for cash-generating units, sensitivity analyses are\\nperformed for the main assumptions in order to rule\\nout that possible changes to the assumptions used to\\ndetermine the recoverable amount would result in the\\nrequirement to recognise an impairment loss. Even in the\\ncase of a 10 % deterioration in the individual measurement assumptions, the need to recognise an impairment\\nloss did not arise.\\n\\nFor machinery used in multiple-shift operations,\\ndepreciation rates are increased to account for the additional utilisation. If there is any indication of impairment\\nof property, plant and equipment, an impairment test is\\nperformed as described above for intangible assets.\\n\\nAll items of property, plant and equipment are measured\\nat acquisition or manufacturing cost less accumulated\\ndepreciation and accumulated impairment losses.

Lease incentives granted by the lessor are deducted. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line\\nbasis over the shorter of the useful life of the leased asset\\nand the expected lease term. If ownership of the leased\\nasset is automatically transferred at the end of the lease\\nterm or the exercise of a purchase option is reflected in\\nthe lease payments, the right-of-use asset is amortised\\non a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of\\nthe leased asset. Right-of-use assets are reported in the\\nbalance sheet within the relevant line items for property,\\nplant and equipment. The amortisation expense on rightof-use assets is reported in the income statement in cost\\nof sales as well as in selling and administrative expenses.\\nThe lease liability is measured on initial recognition\\nat the present value of the future lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the carrying amount of\\nthe lease liability is increased to reflect interest on the\\nlease liability and reduced, without income statement\\nimpact, by the lease payments made. Lease liabilities\\nare reported within financial liabilities, while interest\\nexpense is reported as part of net interest result. In the\\ncash flow statement, both the repayment portion and\\nthe interest portion of lease payments are shown as cash\\noutflows from financing activities.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nGroup Financial Statements\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\\n\\nThe lease payments to be taken into account to measure the right-of-use asset and the lease liability comprise\\nfixed payments, variable lease payments that depend on\\nan index or an interest rate as well as amounts expected\\nto be payable under residual value guarantees. If it is\\nreasonably certain that a purchase or lease extension\\noption will be exercised, the relevant payments are also\\nincluded. Payments for periods for which the lessee\\nhas an option to terminate a lease unilaterally are only\\nincluded in the lease payments if it is reasonably certain\\nthat the termination option will not be exercised. For the\\npurposes of assessing options, the BMW Group takes\\naccount of all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or not to exercise the option.\\nIFRS 16 requires that lease payments are discounted\\nas a general rule using the interest rate implicit in the\\nlease. However, since the interest rate in leases entered\\ninto by the BMW Group cannot readily be determined,\\namounts are discounted on the basis of the incremental\\nborrowing rate, comprising the risk-free interest rate\\nin the relevant currency for matching maturities plus\\na premium for the credit risk. Specific risks attached to\\nan asset are generally not taken into account, given that\\ncollateral received in the context of alternative financing\\narrangements is not relevant within the BMW Group.\\nDetermining which items are to be counted as lease\\npayments – including the issue of the lease term underlying those payments – and which discount rate to apply\\ninvolves using estimates and assumptions that may differ\\nfrom actual outcomes.\\n\\n200\\n\\nAs lessee, the BMW Group makes use of the application exemptions available for short-term leases and leases\\nof low-value assets.\\n\\nmarket data as well as on forecasts of external institutions.

If there\\nis any indication that an investment is impaired, an impairment test is performed on the basis of a discounted\\ncash flow method. An indicator exists, for example, in\\nthe event of a serious shortfall compared to budget, the\\nloss of an active market or if funds are required to avoid\\ninsolvency.\\n\\nGroup products recognised by BMW Group entities\\nas leased products under operating leases are measured\\nat manufacturing cost and all other leased products at\\nacquisition cost, in each case including initial direct costs.\\nAll leased products are depreciated over the period of\\nthe lease using the straight-line method down to their\\nexpected residual value. Where the recoverable amount\\nof a lease exceeds the asset’s carrying amount, changes\\nin residual value expectations are recognised by adjusting\\nscheduled depreciation prospectively over the remaining term of the lease. If the recoverable amount is lower\\nthan the asset’s carrying amount, an impairment loss is\\nrecognised for the shortfall. A test is carried out at each\\nbalance sheet date to determine whether an impairment\\nloss recognised in prior years no longer exists or has decreased. In such cases, the carrying amount of the asset\\nis increased to the recoverable amount, at a maximum\\nup to the amount of the asset’s amortised cost.\\n\\nWith the exception of lease receivables, financial assets\\nare measured on initial recognition at their fair value.\\nFinancial assets include in particular other investments,\\nreceivables from sales financing, marketable securities\\nand investment funds, derivative financial assets, trade\\nreceivables and cash and cash equivalents.

Selected marketable\\nsecurities and investment funds, money market funds\\nwithin cash and cash equivalents as well as convertible\\nbonds are recognised at fair value through profit or loss,\\nas their contractual cash flows do not solely represent\\npayments of principal and interest. The BMW Group\\ndoes not make use of the option to measure equity\\ninstruments at fair value through other comprehensive\\nincome or debt instruments at fair value through profit\\nor loss.\\nThe market values of financial instruments measured\\nat fair value are determined on the basis of market information available at the balance sheet date, such as quoted\\nprices or using appropriate measurement methods, in\\nparticular the discounted cash flow method.\\nItems reported under other investments within the\\nscope of IFRS 9 are measured at fair value through profit\\nor loss. Investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements\\nand associated companies that are not material to the\\nBMW Group are also included in other investments.\\nReceivables from sales financing are measured at\\namortised cost using the effective interest rate method.\\nOperating lease receivables due for payment at the end\\nof the reporting period and included in this balance sheet\\nline item are also measured on this basis, and the related\\nvehicles reported as leased products. Receivables from\\nsales financing also include finance lease receivables\\nwhich are measured at the amount of the net investment\\nin the lease.\\n\\n201\\n\\nWith the exception of receivables from operating\\nleases and trade receivables, the BMW Group applies\\nthe general approach described in IFRS 9 to determine impairment of financial assets. Under the general\\napproach, loss allowances are measured on initial recognition on the basis of the expected 12-month credit loss\\n(stage 1). If the credit loss risk at the end of the reporting\\nperiod has increased significantly since initial recognition, the impairment allowance is measured on the\\nbasis of lifetime expected credit losses (stage 2 – general\\napproach). The measurement of the change in default risk\\nis based on a comparison of the default risk at the date of\\ninitial recognition and at the end of the reporting period.\\nThe default risk at the end of each reporting period is\\ndetermined on the basis of credit checks, current key\\nperformance indicators and any overdue payments.\\nThe BMW Group applies the simplified approach described in IFRS 9 to operating lease and trade receivables,\\nwhereby the amount of the loss allowance is measured\\nsubsequent to the initial recognition of the receivable\\non the basis of lifetime expected credit losses (stage 2 –\\nsimplified approach). For the purposes of allocating at\\nitem to stage 2, it is irrelevant whether the credit risk of\\nthe assets concerned has increased significantly since\\ninitial recognition.\\nAs a general rule, the BMW Group assumes that a\\nreceivable is in default if it is more than 90 days overdue\\nor if there are objective indications of insolvency, such as\\nthe opening of insolvency proceedings. Credit-impaired\\nassets are identified as such on the basis of this definition\\nof default. In the case of credit-impaired assets which had\\n\\nnot been credit-impaired at the time they were acquired\\nor originated, an impairment allowance is recognised at\\nan amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses (stage\\n3). This is the case regardless of whether the general or\\nsimplified approach is applied. In the case of stage 3 assets, interest income is calculated on the asset’s carrying\\namount less any impairment loss.\\nThe BMW Group derecognises financial assets when\\nit has no reasonable expectation of recovery. This may\\nbe the case, for instance, if the debtor is deemed not\\nto have sufficient assets or other sources of income to\\nservice the debt.\\nLoss allowances relating to the balance sheet item\\n“Receivables from sales financing” are determined primarily on the basis of past experience with credit losses,\\ncurrent data on overdue receivables, rating classes and\\nscoring information.

Input factors available on the market, such as\\nratings and probabilities of default, are used to calculate valuation allowance for cash and cash equivalents,\\nfinancial receivables, receivables from subsidiaries and\\nreceivables from companies in which an investment is\\nheld. In the case of marketable securities and investment\\nfunds, the BMW Group usually applies the option not to\\nallocate financial assets with a low default risk to different stages. Accordingly, assets with an investment grade\\nrating are always allocated to stage 1.\\nExpected credit losses are only presented separately\\nif they are material for the BMW Group Financial Statements.\\nDerivative financial instruments are used within the\\nBMW Group for hedging purposes in order to reduce\\ncurrency, interest rate, fair value and market price risks.\\nDerivative financial instruments are recognised as of the\\ntrade date, measured at their fair value.

Observable market price, tenor and currency\\nbasis spreads are taken into account in the measurement\\nof derivative financial instruments. Furthermore, the\\nGroup’s own credit risk and that of counterparties is\\ntaken into account on the basis of credit default swap\\nvalues for market contracts with matching terms.\\n\\n202\\n\\nThe BMW Group applies the option to recognise the\\ncredit risks arising from the fair values of a group of\\nderivative financial assets and liabilities on the basis of\\ntheir total net amount. Portfolio-based valuation adjustments (credit valuation adjustments and debit valuation\\nadjustments) to the individual derivative financial assets\\nand financial liabilities are allocated using the relative\\nfair value approach (net method).\\nWhere hedge accounting is applied, changes in fair\\nvalue of derivative financial instruments are presented\\nas part of other financial result in the income statement\\nor within other comprehensive income as a component\\nof accumulated other equity, depending on whether the\\nhedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge or\\na cash flow hedge.\\nFair value hedges are mainly used to hedge interest\\nrate risks relating to financial liabilities. The currency\\nbasis is not designated as part of the hedging relationship\\nin the case of cross currency interest rate hedges accounted for as fair value hedges. Accordingly, changes in the\\nmarket value of such components are recorded as costs\\nof hedging within accumulated other equity. Amounts\\naccumulated in equity are reclassified to other financial\\nresult within the income statement over the term of the\\nhedging relationship.\\nIn addition, for selected fixed-interest assets, a\\nportion of the interest rate risk is hedged on a portfolio\\nbasis in accordance with IAS 39. The designated hedged\\nitems (underlying transactions) are reported in the\\nbalance sheet as receivables from sales financing and\\nfinancial liabilities. In this case, swaps are used as the\\nhedging instrument. Hedge relationships are terminated\\n\\nand redesignated on a monthly basis at the end of each\\nreporting period, thereby taking account of the constantly changing content of each portfolio.\\nFair value hedge ineffectiveness is generally recognised in other financial result.\\nThe time values of option transactions and the interest component – including the currency basis – of\\nforward currency contracts are not designated as part of\\nthe hedging relationship in the case of currency hedges\\naccounted for as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair\\nvalue of such components are recorded as costs of hedging on a separate line within accumulated other equity.\\nAmounts recorded in accumulated other equity from\\ncurrency hedges are reclassified to cost of sales when\\nthe related hedged item is recognised in profit or loss.\\nIn the case of raw materials hedges that are accounted for as cash flow hedges, the hedging instruments are\\ndesignated in full as part of the hedging relationship.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured\\nat the tax rates that are expected to apply for the period\\nwhen the asset is realised or the liability settled, based\\non tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets is assessed at\\neach balance sheet date on the basis of planned taxable\\nincome in future financial years. If with a probability\\nof more than 50 percent future tax benefits will not be\\nrealised, either in part or in total, a valuation allowance\\nis recognised on the deferred tax assets. The calculation\\nof deferred tax assets requires assumptions to be made\\nwith regard to the level of future taxable income and the\\ntiming of recovery of deferred tax assets. These assumptions take account of forecast operating results and the\\nimpact on earnings of the reversal of taxable temporary\\ndifferences. Since future business developments cannot\\nbe predicted with certainty and to some extent cannot\\nbe influenced by the BMW Group, the measurement of\\ndeferred tax assets is subject to uncertainty.\\nDeferred tax liabilities on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, branches\\nand associated companies as well as interests in joint\\narrangements are not recognised if the Group is able\\nto control the timing of the reversal and it is probable\\nthat the temporary difference will not reverse in the\\n\\n203\\n\\nforeseeable future. This is particularly the case if it is\\nintended that profits will not be distributed, but rather\\nwill be used to maintain the substance and expand the\\nvolume of business of the entities concerned.\\nCurrent income taxes are calculated within the\\nBMW Group on the basis of tax legislation applicable\\nin the relevant countries. To the extent that judgement\\nwas necessary to determine the treatment and amount\\nof tax items presented in the financial statements, there\\nis in principle a possibility that local tax authorities may\\ntake a different position.\\nAs a general rule, each income tax treatment is considered independently when accounting for uncertainties\\nin income taxes. If it is not considered probable that an\\nincome tax treatment will be accepted by the local tax\\nauthorities, the BMW Group uses the most likely amount\\nof the tax treatment when determining taxable profit\\nand the tax base.\\nInventories of raw materials, supplies and goods for\\nresale are stated at the lower of average acquisition cost\\nand net realisable value.\\nWork in progress and finished goods, as well as vehicles held for sale in the financial services business, are\\nstated at the lower of manufacturing cost and net realisable value.

Although customer demand increased in\\nmany markets during the second half of the year, the\\nrepercussions of the coronavirus pandemic on business\\nin the first half of the year continued to be felt. This is\\nreflected in particular in the decline in revenues, mainly due to the lower number of vehicle sales and lower\\nrevenues from spare parts. The decline in vehicle sales\\nwas also reflected in cost of sales, whereby fixed costs\\nfell on a less pronounced scale by comparison to the\\nreduction in capacity utilisation levels. Group earnings\\nwere also negatively impacted by higher risk provisioning\\nexpenses relating in particular to the reassessment of\\nresidual value and credit risks.\\n\\nDue to lower new leasing business as well as lower\\nexpected new leasing business, the amount of revenues\\neliminated on consolidation fell compared to the previous year.\\nThe year-on-year decrease in selling and administrative expenses mainly reflected the reduction in communication, marketing and travel expenses arising as\\na result of the containment measures implemented in\\nconnection with the coronavirus pandemic. Short-time\\nwork allowances received have been netted in the income\\nstatement against the corresponding expenses.\\nIn light of the developments described above, Group\\nnet profit was significantly lower than in the previous\\nyear.\\nSignificant effects on the Group Financial Statements\\nare described below.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nGroup Financial Statements\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\\n\\nACCOUNTING POLICIES\\n\\nImpairment tests\\nThe increasing global spread of the coronavirus and\\nthe related low market capitalisation of BMW AG gave\\nrise to an indication that tangible and intangible assets\\nof the BMW Group could be impaired. As a result, impairment tests were performed for the Automotive, Motorcycles and Financial Services cash-generating units.\\nIn this context, values in use were determined on the\\nbasis of updated long-term forecasts that already reflect\\nadjustments to expectations made in light of coronavirus. Against this backdrop, it was decided not to include\\nprobability-weighted scenarios. A detailed description of\\nthe methodology applied to perform impairment tests is\\nprovided in note 5 .\\nFrom the BMW Group’s perspective, the spread of\\ncoronavirus also provided an indication of impairment\\nrelating to investments accounted for using the equity\\nmethod. The exception to this general consideration was\\nthe BMW Brilliance Automotive joint venture in China,\\ngiven the rapid economic recovery registered in that\\nregion. Further information is provided in note 24 .\\n\\n206\\n\\nDe-designation of hedge relationships\\nFor the purposes of accounting for currency and\\ncommodity hedges, coronavirus-related effects on sales\\nand production were taken into account as unscheduled\\nexposure updates. If the hedged item was no longer\\nexpected to occur, the hedge relationships were dedesignated. The corresponding amounts were then reclassified immediately from other comprehensive income\\nto profit and loss (other operating income and expenses).\\nResidual value risk\\nFor the purposes of measuring and accounting for residual value risks, discretionary adjustments were made\\nto the expected market values of vehicles in order to take\\naccount of the effects of the pandemic that are not considered in the existing measurement models (post-model\\nadjustments). The adjustments were determined using a\\nmarket-specific approach, thereby taking account of the\\nvarying effects and measures arising in each market as\\nwell as the structure of the valuation models.\\nIn the case of the US market, past experience\\nrelevant for market value changes arising during the\\nfinancial crisis was taken into account in the calculation\\nof post-model adjustments. In the case of the UK and\\nCanadian markets, the procedures applied also included\\nprojections drawn up by external providers on the impact\\nof the coronavirus pandemic. In all cases, assumptions\\n\\npertaining to the scale and duration of the pandemic’s effects took account of current market value developments.\\nIf the regression models used were highly affected by\\nmarket values realised in recent months, the outcomes\\nwere adjusted for exceptionally positive results in the\\nsecond half of the year for instance, in the UK and the\\nNetherlands. In the case of the Belgian and German markets, for instance, procedures included the derivation\\nof a number of macroeconomic scenarios to calculate\\nthe potential impact on pre-owned vehicle valuations.\\nProbabilities were weighted where necessary, taking into\\naccount external indicators (e. g. consumer confidence\\nindices) and internal indicators (e. g. inventory trends).\\nIn some cases, including for the French market, macroeconomic parameters based on current risk estimates\\nwere adjusted.\\nDiscretionary model adjustments are regularly reviewed in order to ensure that allowances for residual\\nvalue losses are continuously updated on the basis of\\nexpected market values. In light of the volatile market\\nenvironment and the current high level of uncertainty\\nsurrounding the future course of the coronavirus pandemic, only limited conclusions can be drawn from the\\nrecent improvement in market values observed on preowned automobile markets. A summary of the relevant\\nvalues is provided in note 23 .\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nGroup Financial Statements\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\\n\\nCredit risk\\nI. Receivables from sales financing\\nIn connection with the coronavirus pandemic, allowances for expected credit losses were increased to\\ntake account of the negative impact on retail customer\\nand dealership business, to the extent not covered by\\nthe BMW Group’s standard loss provisioning models\\n(post-model adjustments).\\nIn the case of retail customer business, portfolios\\nwere measured taking into account market-specific\\nqualitative factors with the aim of identifying particularly affected portfolio segments (such as the tourism\\nsector). This assessment was based on local expertise\\nand took into account various scenarios, including the\\nnumber of payment deferral applications, government\\nmeasures and additional qualitative portfolio data. For\\nthe identified portfolio segments affected, amounts were\\nreclassified from stage 1 (impairment allowance based on\\nthe 12-month expected credit losses) to stage 2 (impairment allowance based on lifetime expected credit losses),\\nresulting in the recognition of additional risk allowances.\\nCredit risk parameters were otherwise left unchanged.\\nIn the case of dealership business, creditworthiness\\nexpectations of individual dealerships were assessed\\non the basis of market-specific scenarios, including\\n\\n207\\n\\ndowngrades based on adjusted expectations of future\\nbusiness performance. In this context, increased default\\nprobabilities were assigned to dealerships that could be\\nexposed to deteriorating business conditions as a result\\nof the coronavirus pandemic. However, this reassessment\\ndid not result in amounts being reclassified from stage\\n1 to stage 2 or stage 3. Instead, additional impairment\\nallowances were recognised to take account of the higher\\nanticipated risk of default.\\n\\noverdue status of these receivables is seen as a risk. A\\nsimulated reclassification of receivables to a higher overdue band was run, taking account of macroeconomic\\ninfluencing factors, the development of the gross domestic product (GDP), of the countries concerned. An additional allowance for expected credit losses was calculated\\nand recorded on the basis of this simulation. Further\\ninformation on the calculation of valuation allowances\\nin accordance with IFRS 9 is provided in note 5 .\\n\\nFurthermore, additional scenarios were considered\\nfor the economic development of individual markets\\n(for example, the UK), for which an increased level of\\nuncertainty exists. In addition, in light of current risk\\nassessments, macroeconomic parameters were adjusted\\nto take account of specific circumstances in some markets\\n(for instance, South Africa and Malaysia). A summary of\\nthe values is provided in note 25 .\\n\\nOverall, the additional impairment losses described\\nabove were offset by a volume-related decrease in receivables. The lower level of impairment allowances compared to 31 December 2019 therefore arose as a result of\\nthe lower level of receivables overall. A summary of the\\nrelevant values is provided in note 30.\\n\\nII. Trade receivables\\nThe effects of a higher risk on receivables within\\nstage 2 were calculated using a scenario model as the\\nbasis for recognising additional credit risk allowances\\nfor trade receivables. The standard model used by the\\nBMW Group to determine expected credit losses is\\nunable – at present – to appropriately take account of\\nthe impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

KG (IONITY), Munich, and the\\ninterest in the associated company THERE Holding B. V.\\n(THERE), Rijswijk.\\nBMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd.\\nBMW Brilliance produces BMW brand models mainly\\nfor the Chinese market and also has engine manufacturing facilities, which supply the joint venture’s two plants\\nwith petrol engines.\\nThe BMW Group intends to increase its stake in\\nthe BMW Brilliance joint venture from 50 % to 75 %. On\\n11 October 2018, the BMW Group signed an agreement\\nwith its joint venture partner, a wholly owned subsidiary\\nof Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd. (CBA), to\\nacquire an additional 25 % shareholding in BMW Brilliance. The two partners agreed on a purchase price\\nof an equivalent of € 3.6 billion. The contractual term\\nof the joint venture, which would currently expire in\\n2028, is to be extended to 2040 as part of the agreement.\\nThe prerequisite for the extension is the acquisition of\\nthe additional shares as agreed. The agreement was\\napproved at the CBA shareholders’ meeting on 18 January 2019 and remains subject to the approval of the\\nrelevant authorities. The transaction is scheduled to\\nclose in 2022. The closing will result in BMW Brilliance\\nbeing fully consolidated in the BMW Group Financial\\nStatements and is expected to result in the recognition of\\na significant valuation gain in the financial year in which\\nthe transaction closes.\\n\\n222\\n\\nYOUR NOW\\nWith effect from 31 January 2019, the BMW Group\\ncompleted the merger of several mobility services\\ncompanies under the name YOUR NOW. The at-equity\\nloss reported for YOUR NOW Holding GmbH for 2020\\namounted to € 349 million (2019: loss of € 662 million).\\nThis loss includes impairment losses amounting to\\n€ 113 million (2019: loss of € 277 million), recorded at the\\nlevel of YOUR NOW Holding GmbH. The impairment\\nlosses arose in light of the fact that – with respect to its\\nimpact on the BMW Group’s investments accounted for\\nusing the equity method – the spread of the coronavirus\\ngave rise to an indication of possible impairment, both\\nat the level of the BMW Group and at the level of YOUR\\nNOW Holding GmbH. The test only resulted in the need\\nto recognise an impairment loss at the level of YOUR\\nNOW Holding GmbH. In the previous year, impairment\\nlosses amounting to € 240 million were also recognised\\nin the BMW Group Financial Statements on the carrying\\namount of individual YOUR NOW companies. These\\nimpairment losses were reported in the result on investments within other financial result.\\nIONITY\\nTogether with Daimler AG, Stuttgart (Daimler AG),\\nthe Ford Motor Company, the Volkswagen Group, Kia\\nMotors Corporation and Hyundai Motor Corporation,\\nthe BMW Group operates the joint venture IONITY\\nHolding GmbH & Co. KG, whereby each of the parties\\nhas an equal shareholding. The entry of Kia Motors\\nCorporation and Hyundai Motor Corporation was completed in October 2020. Since then, the BMW Group\\nhas held a 20 % stake in IONITY. IONITY’s business\\nmodel envisages the construction and operation of\\nhigh-performance charging stations for battery electric\\nvehicles in Europe.\\n\\nTHERE\\nTogether with AUDI AG, Daimler AG and other companies, the BMW Group holds shares in THERE. HERE\\nInternational B. V. (HERE) is an associated company of\\nTHERE. HERE’s digital maps are laying the foundations\\nfor the next generation of mobility and location-based\\nservices, providing the basis for new assistance systems\\nand, ultimately, fully automated driving.\\nIn December 2019, it was announced that Mitsubishi\\nCorporation (MC) and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone\\nCorporation (NTT) would jointly acquire a 30 % stake\\nin HERE. This acquisition was completed in May 2020\\nfollowing the receipt of approval from the antitrust authorities. The sale of the shares gave rise to a positive impact of € 105 million which is reported within the result\\nfrom equity accounted investments. In addition, share\\ncapital reductions were carried out at the level of THERE\\nin June and September 2020, resulting in € 197 million\\nbeing returned to the BMW Group.\\nThe spread of the coronavirus also gave rise to an indication of possible impairment from the BMW Group’s\\nperspective. The impairment test was based on HERE’s\\ncurrent business plan, which already incorporates\\nits lowered expectations in the wake of the coronavirus\\npandemic. The value in use was determined on the basis\\nof a present value computation derived from the revised\\nbusiness plan. A pre-tax discount rate of 18.5 % was\\napplied. Following the impairment test, an impairment\\nloss of € 27 million was recognised in the BMW Group\\nFinancial Statements and included in the result on investments within other financial

Plan assets\\nof the BMW Group include own transferable financial\\ninstruments amounting to € 1 million (2019: € 8 million).\\nThe BMW Group is exposed to risks arising both from\\ndefined benefit plans and defined contribution plans with\\na minimum return guarantee. The discount rates used to\\ncalculate pension obligations are subject to market fluctuation and therefore influence the level of the obligations.\\nFurthermore, changes in other actuarial parameters, such\\nas expected rates of inflation, also have an impact on pension obligations. In order to reduce currency exposures, a\\nsubstantial portion of plan assets is either invested in the\\n\\nsame currency as the underlying plan or hedged by means\\nof currency derivatives. As part of the internal reporting procedures and for internal management purposes,\\nfinancial risks relating to the pension plans are reported\\nusing a value-at-risk approach by reference to the pension\\ndeficit. The investment strategy is also subject to regular\\nreview together with external consultants, with the aim\\nof ensuring that investments are structured to match the\\ntiming of pension payments and the expected development of pension obligations. In this way, fluctuations in\\npension funding shortfalls are reduced.\\nThe defined benefit obligation relates to current employees, pensioners and former employees with vested\\nbenefits as follows:\\n\\nGermany\\nin %\\n\\nUnited Kingdom\\n\\nOther\\n\\n31. 12. 2020\\n\\n31. 12. 2019\\n\\n31. 12. 2020\\n\\n31. 12. 2019\\n\\n31. 12. 2020\\n\\n31. 12. 2019\\n\\nCurrent employees\\n\\n66.2\\n\\n67.6\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n62.9\\n\\n64.3\\n\\nPensioners\\n\\n27.4\\n\\n27.4\\n\\n42.2\\n\\n45.5\\n\\n29.9\\n\\n29.0\\n\\n6.4\\n\\n5.0\\n\\n57.8\\n\\n54.5\\n\\n7.2\\n\\n6.8\\n\\n100.0\\n\\n100.0\\n\\n100.0\\n\\n100.0\\n\\n100.0\\n\\n100.0\\n\\nFormer employees with vested benefits\\nDefined benefit obligation\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nGroup Financial Statements\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\\n\\n236\\n\\nThe sensitivity analysis provided below shows the\\nextent to which changes in individual factors – independently of each other – could influence the defined\\nbenefit obligation at the end of the reporting period.\\nIt is only possible to aggregate sensitivities to a\\nlimited extent.

The\\nBMW Group has provided for the potential outcome of\\n\\nthe investigation in the form of a provision measured\\non the basis of the Statement of Objections, at the best\\npossible estimate (see also note 10 to the Group Financial\\nStatements for the financial year 2019).

The class action lawsuits in the USA were dismissed in the first instance\\nin October 2020. The plaintiffs have appealed this\\ndecision. Class action lawsuits in Canada and private\\nlawsuits in South Korea are still at an early stage. Further\\ncivil lawsuits based on the allegations are possible going\\nforward.

cost\\nThe following table shows the fair values and carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities that are\\nmeasured at amortised cost and whose carrying amounts\\ndiffer from their fair value.\\nThe fair values are generally determined using the\\ndiscounted cash flow method, taking into account the\\nrelevant risk of default. For the purposes of fair value\\nmeasurement using the discounted cash flow method,\\nexpected future cash flows are discounted on the basis\\nof up-to-date interest curves observable on the market.\\nThe fair values of receivables from sales financing\\nare measured using the discounted cash flow method,\\ntaking into account customer-specific credit risk. In view\\nof the fact that these allowances are calculated in part on\\nthe basis of internal information, receivables from sales\\n\\n245\\n\\nfinancing are allocated to Level 3 in the level hierarchy in\\naccordance with IFRS 13. The fair values of the financial\\nassets shown in the table relate to financial institutions\\nand are also measured using the discounted cash flow\\nmethod, taking into account the risk of default.

The\\nvaluation of unquoted equity instruments is determined\\nprimarily using the market-based approach. In particular,\\nthe financing rounds that take place within the private\\nequity sector – usually on a regular basis at intervals of\\napproximately 12 to 24 months – represent a significant\\ninput factor for these purposes. In addition, the investment advisor provides the external fund manager with\\nrelevant, investment-specific information on an ongoing\\nbasis (at least quarterly). The latter subsequently assesses\\nthe underlying individual companies in accordance with\\nthe guidelines for International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuations (IPEV).\\nAs part of the process of analysing valuations, the\\nexternal fund manager reviews the investment-specific\\nmilestones, including an analysis of financial, technical\\nand liquidity-specific performance indicators. Based on\\nthis analysis, it is considered whether the price of the\\nmost recent financing round is acceptable as a reasonable\\nmarket valuation, in particular for early-stage or growthphase investments. Key performance indicators used for\\nthe purpose of milestone analysis are highly dependent\\non the business model underlying the investment': None, ' typical\\n\\ntechnical key performance indicators relate to licenses\\nand patents held, the stage of technology development\\nsuch as evidence of feasibility and prototypes, market entries, customer and user growth and appointments to key\\nmanagement positions. Key financial performance indicators used are revenues, EBITDA and the corresponding\\ngrowth rate and / or development of specific contribution\\nmargins. Key liquidity-specific performance indicators\\nare cash on hand, cash burn rates and prospects for\\nfuture financing rounds.\\nSince the pricing of equity investments derived from\\nfinancing rounds is considered to be the key input factor\\nfor the valuation, adjustments in valuation give rise to a\\nsimilar change in the equity instrument that is required\\nto be recorded with income statement effect.\\nIn addition, the valuation of selected equity instruments is based on the income approach. This involves\\ndiscounting cash flows on the basis of current business\\ncases using the weighted average cost of capital to\\ndetermine the fair value of the financial instrument.\\nChanges in fair values determined in connection with\\nadjustments to significant input factors are not material\\nfor the BMW Group.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nGroup Financial Statements\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\\n\\nThe convertible bonds that have been classified to\\nLevel 3 are primarily used as instruments in advance of\\nfuture financing rounds relating to private equity investments.

Information on the\\nmanagement of credit risk for receivables from financial services is provided in the Combined Management\\nReport (see section Report on Outlook, Risks and Opportunities).\\nNotwithstanding the existence of collateral accepted, the carrying amount of financial assets (with the\\nexception of derivative financial instruments) generally\\nrepresents the maximum credit risk. In addition, the\\ncredit risk is increased by additional unutilised loan commitments in the dealership financing line of business.\\nTotal dealership financing credit risk at the end of the\\nreporting period therefore amounted to € 30,682 million\\n(2019: € 31,943 million).\\nIn the case of all relationships underlying nonderivative financial instruments, in order to minimise\\nthe credit risk and depending on the nature and amount\\nof exposure, collateral is required, credit information\\nand references obtained or historical data based on the\\nexisting business relationship, in particular payment\\nbehaviour, reviewed.\\nIn the case of trade receivables, customers are regularly assessed with regard to their credit risk. Depending on contractual status, necessary measures, such as\\ndunning procedures, are initiated in good time.\\n\\n250\\n\\nThe credit risk relating to cash deposits and derivative financial instruments is minimised by the fact that\\nthe Group only enters into such contracts with parties\\nof first-class credit standing.\\nWithin the financial services business, items financed for retail customers and dealerships (such as\\nvehicles, facilities and property) serve as first-ranking\\ncollateral with a recoverable value. Security is also put\\nup by customers in the form of collateral asset pledges,\\nasset assignment and first-ranking mortgages, supplemented where appropriate by warranties and guarantees.\\nItems previously held as collateral that are subsequently\\nacquired relate mainly to vehicles. As a rule, these assets can be converted into cash at short notice through\\nthe dealership organisation. Creditworthiness testing\\nis an important aspect of the BMW Group’s credit risk\\nmanagement. Every borrower’s creditworthiness is tested for all credit financing and lease contracts entered\\ninto by the BMW Group. In the case of retail customer\\nfinancing, creditworthiness is assessed using validated\\nscoring systems integrated in the acquisition process.\\nIn the area of dealership financing, creditworthiness is\\nassessed by means of ongoing credit monitoring and\\nan internal rating system that takes account not only of\\nthe material credit standing of the borrower, but also of\\nqualitative factors, such as past reliability in business\\nrelations.\\n\\nThe credit risk on trade receivables is assessed mainly\\non the basis of information relating to overdue amounts.\\nThe gross carrying amounts of these receivables are allocated in accordance with IFRS 9 to overdue ranges used\\nfor management purposes as follows:\\nin € million\\n\\n31. 12. 2020\\n\\n31. 12. 2019\\n\\n2,002\\n\\n1,947\\n\\n1 – 30 days overdue\\n\\n229\\n\\n369\\n\\n31 – 60 days overdue\\n\\n31\\n\\n89\\n\\n61 – 90 days overdue\\n\\n23\\n\\n40\\n\\nMore than 90 days overdue\\n\\n60\\n\\n145\\n\\n2,345\\n\\n2,590\\n\\nNot overdue\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nGroup Financial Statements\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\\n\\n251\\n\\nReceivables from sales financing are allocated to\\ninternally defined rating categories based on credit risk.\\nThe classification into creditworthiness levels is based on\\ndefault probabilities.

In order to hedge\\ncurrency risks, the BMW Group holds, as at 31 December 2020, derivative financial instruments mostly in the\\nform of forward currency contracts and currency swaps.\\n\\n253\\n\\nAs part of the implementation of the risk management strategy, the extent to which risk exposures should\\nbe hedged is decided at regular intervals. The economic\\nrelationship between the hedged item and the hedging\\ninstrument is based essentially on the fact that they are\\ndenominated in the same currency and have the same\\nmaturities. Items are hedged on the basis of a constant\\nratio of one to one between hedging instrument and risk\\nexposure.\\nCauses of hedge ineffectiveness are seen potentially\\nonly for counterparty credit risk. However, in view of\\nthe processes that have been established for credit risk\\nmanagement, ineffectiveness is not expected to arise.\\nThe BMW Group measures currency risk using a\\ncash-flow-at-risk model. The analysis of currency risk is\\nbased on forecast foreign currency transactions which\\ncould result in exposures to surpluses of foreign currency\\ncash inflows and cash outflows. At the end of the reporting period, the overall currency exposure – in each case\\nfor the following year and determined by aggregating the\\nindividual currency exposures based on their absolute\\namount – was as follows:\\nin € million\\n\\nCurrency exposure\\n\\n31. 12. 2020\\n\\n31. 12. 2019\\n\\n33,975\\n\\n33,950\\n\\nCurrency exposures include short positions amounting to € 5,222 million (2019: € 2,789 million).\\nThis exposure is compared to all hedges that are in\\nplace. The net cash flow surplus represents an uncovered\\nrisk position.

At the BMW Group, all items subject to, or\\nbearing, interest are exposed to interest rate risk and\\ncan therefore affect both the assets and liabilities side\\nof the balance sheet.\\nThe fair value of the Group’s interest rate portfolios\\nwas as follows at the end of the reporting period:\\nin € million\\n\\nFair values of interest rate portfolios\\n\\n31. 12. 2020\\n\\n31. 12. 2019\\n\\n58,545\\n\\n55,697\\n\\nInterest rate risk is managed through the use of\\ninterest rate derivatives. As part of the implementation of the risk management strategy, interest rate\\nrisks are monitored and managed at regular intervals.\\nThe interest rate contracts used for hedging purposes\\ncomprise mainly swaps, which, if hedge accounting is\\napplied, are accounted for as fair value hedges. The\\neconomic relationship between the hedged item and the\\nhedging instrument is based on the fact that the main\\nparameters of the hedged item and the related hedging\\ninstrument, for example start date, term and currency,\\nare the same. Items are hedged on the basis of a constant ratio of one to one between hedging instrument\\nand risk exposure.\\nIn view of the fact that own credit risk is excluded\\nfrom the hedging relationship, ineffectiveness is expected\\nto be low.\\nFor selected fixed-interest assets, part of the interest\\nrate risk is hedged on a portfolio basis. In this case, swaps\\n\\nare used as the hedging instrument. Hedge relationships\\nare terminated and redesignated on a monthly basis at\\nthe end of each reporting period, thereby taking account\\nof the constantly changing content of each portfolio.\\nIn view of the plans to reform and replace certain\\nbenchmark interest rates, the timing and exact nature\\nof these changes is currently subject to uncertainty.\\nAcross the BMW Group, a considerable number of contracts are directly affected by the benchmark interest\\nrates reform. Hedging relationships entered into by the\\nBMW Group are mainly based on USD LIBOR and GBP\\nLIBOR benchmark interest rates, which are designated\\nas hedged risks in fair value hedging relationships. The\\nhedging relationships affected are subject to uncertainty with respect to the identifiability of the designated\\nbenchmark interest rates.\\nThe transition to the newly created or revised benchmark rates is being managed and monitored as part of\\na multidisciplinary project. The conversion project will\\ninvolve making changes to systems, processes, risk and\\nvaluation models, as well as dealing with the associated\\naccounting implications. The uncertainty arising from\\nthe benchmark interest rate reform is likely to continue\\nto exist up to the end of 2021.\\nThe BMW Group applies a value-at-risk approach\\nthroughout the Group for internal reporting purposes\\nand to manage interest rate risk. This approach is based\\non a historical simulation in which the potential future\\nfair value losses of the interest rate portfolios are compared across the Group with expected amounts on the\\nbasis of a holding period of 250 days and a confidence\\nlevel of 99.98 %. The risk mitigating effect of correlations\\nbetween the various portfolios is taken into account\\nwhen the risks are aggregated.\\n\\nIn the following table, the potential volumes of fair\\nvalue fluctuations – measured on the basis of the value-at-risk approach – are compared with the expected\\nvalue for the interest-rate-sensitive exposures of the\\nBMW Group:\\nin € million\\n\\nValue at risk\\n\\n31. 12. 2020\\n\\n31. 12. 2019\\n\\n1,160\\n\\n1,094\\n\\nRaw materials price risk\\nThe BMW Group is exposed to market price risks on\\nraw materials. In order to hedge these risks, the Group\\nmainly uses forward commodity contracts. As part of\\nthe implementation of the risk management strategy,\\nthe extent to which risk exposures should be hedged\\nis decided at regular intervals and the corresponding\\nhedging ratio defined. Items are hedged on the basis of a\\nconstant ratio of one to one between hedging instrument\\nand risk exposure.\\nCauses of hedge ineffectiveness are seen potentially\\nonly for counterparty credit risk. However, in view of\\nthe processes that have been established for credit risk\\nmanagement, ineffectiveness is not expected to arise.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nGroup Financial Statements\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\\n\\n255\\n\\nThe economic relationship between the hedged item\\nand the hedging instrument is based essentially on the\\nfact that they have the same basis and term.

Other price\\ncomponents contained in the contract are not designated\\nas being part of the hedge relationship as no effective\\nhedging instruments exist for these components.\\nThe starting point for analysing raw materials price\\nrisk is to identify planned purchases of raw materials\\nor components containing raw materials, the so-called\\n“exposure”.

In return for the investment requirement,\\nBMW AG pays 100 % of the investment amount as a net\\nsubsidy. Once the four-year holding period requirement\\nhas been fulfilled, the participants receive – for each\\nthree common stock shares held and at the Company’s\\noption – one additional share of common stock or the\\ncash equivalent, to be decided at BMW AG’s discretion.\\nFor financial years beginning after 1 January 2011,\\nBMW AG has added a share-based remuneration component to the existing compensation system for Board\\nof Management members.\\nMembers of the Board of Management receive a\\ncash compensation (investment component) for the\\nspecific purpose of investment – after tax and contributions – in shares of common stock of BMW AG. For the\\nfinancial years 2018 to 2020, the investment component\\ncorresponds to 45 % of the gross bonus.

In\\nthe event of death or invalidity, special rules apply for\\nearly payment of share-based remuneration components\\nbased on the target amounts.

The segmentation follows the internal management and reporting\\nsystem and takes account of the organisational structure\\nof the BMW Group based on the various products and\\nservices of the reportable segments.\\nThe activities of the BMW Group are broken down\\ninto the operating segments Automotive, Motorcycles,\\nFinancial Services and Other Entities.\\n\\n264\\n\\nWithin the Automotive segment, the BMW Group\\ndevelops, manufactures, assembles and sells automobiles\\nand off-road vehicles, under the brands BMW, MINI\\nand Rolls-Royce as well as spare parts, accessories and\\nmobility services. BMW and MINI brand products are\\nsold in Germany through branches of BMW AG and\\nby independent, authorised dealerships. Sales outside\\nGermany are handled mainly by subsidiary companies\\nand by independent import companies in some markets.\\nRolls-Royce brand vehicles are sold in selected markets\\nvia subsidiary companies and elsewhere by independent,\\nauthorised dealers.\\nActivities relating to the development, manufacture,\\nassembly and sale of motorcycles as well as spare parts\\nand accessories are reported in the Motorcycles segment.\\nAutomobile leasing, fleet business, multi-brand business, retail and dealership financing, customer deposit\\nbusiness and insurance activities are the main activities\\nallocated to the Financial Services segment.\\n\\nHolding and Group financing companies are reported in the Other Entities segment. This segment also\\nincludes the operating companies BMW (UK) Investments Ltd. and Bavaria Lloyd Reisebüro GmbH, which\\nare not allocated to one of the other segments.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nGroup Financial Statements\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\\n\\nInternal management and reporting\\nSegment information is prepared as a general rule in\\nconformity with the accounting policies adopted for preparing and presenting the Group Financial Statements.\\nExceptions to this general principle include the treatment of inter-segment warranties, the earnings impact\\nof which is allocated to the Automotive and Financial\\nServices segments on the basis used internally to manage\\nthe business. In addition, intragroup repurchase agreements between the Automotive and Financial Services\\nsegments pursuant to IFRS 15, impairment allowances\\non intragroup receivables and changes in the value of\\nconsolidated other investments pursuant to IFRS 9 are\\nalso excluded. Intragroup leasing arrangements are not\\nreflected in the internal management and reporting\\nsystem on an IFRS 16 basis and therefore, in accordance with IFRS 8, do not give rise to any changes in the\\npresentation of segment information. Inter-segment receivables and payables, provisions, income, expenses and\\nprofits are eliminated upon consolidation. Inter-segment\\nrevenues are based on market prices. Centralised functions are included in the segments concerned. Expenses\\nfor centralised administrative functions allocated to the\\nFinancial Services segment are not settled in cash.\\n\\n265\\n\\nThe role of “chief operating decision maker” with respect to resource allocation and performance assessment\\nof the reportable segment is embodied in the full Board\\nof Management. For this purpose, different measures of\\nsegment performance as well as segment assets are taken\\ninto account in the operating segments.\\nThe Automotive and Motorcycles segments are managed on the basis of return on capital employed (RoCE).\\nThe relevant measure of segment results used is therefore\\nprofit before financial result. Capital employed is the corresponding measure of segment assets used to determine\\nhow to allocate resources and comprises all current and\\nnon-current operational assets after deduction of liabilities used operationally which are generally not subject\\nto interest (e. g. trade payables).\\nThe success of the Financial Services segment is\\nmeasured on the basis of return on equity (RoE). Profit\\nbefore tax therefore represents the relevant measure of\\nsegment earnings. The measure of segment assets in the\\nFinancial Services segment corresponds to net assets,\\ndefined as total assets less total liabilities.\\n\\nThe success of the Other Entities segment is assessed\\non the basis of profit or loss before tax. The corresponding measure of segment assets used to manage the Other\\nEntities segment is total assets less asset-side income tax\\nitems and intragroup investments.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nGroup Financial Statements\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\\n\\n266\\n\\nSegment information by operating segment is as\\nfollows:\\nAutomotive\\nin € million\\n\\nMotorcycles\\n\\nFinancial Services\\n\\nReconciliation\\nto Group figures\\n\\nOther Entities\\n\\n2020\\n\\n2019\\n\\n2020\\n\\n2019\\n\\n2020\\n\\n2019\\n\\n2020\\n\\n2019\\n\\nExternal revenues\\n\\n68,106\\n\\n73,624\\n\\n2,293\\n\\n2,374\\n\\n28,590\\n\\n28,210\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\nInter-segment revenues\\n\\n12,747\\n\\n18,058\\n\\n–9\\n\\n–6\\n\\n1,454\\n\\n1,388\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\nTotal revenues\\n\\n80,853\\n\\n91,682\\n\\n2,284\\n\\n2,368\\n\\n30,044\\n\\n29,598\\n\\n3\\n\\n5\\n\\nSegment result\\n\\n2020\\n\\nGroup\\n\\n2019\\n\\n2020\\n\\n2019\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n98,990\\n\\n104,210\\n\\n– 14,194\\n\\n– 19,443\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n– 14,194\\n\\n– 19,443\\n\\n98,990\\n\\n104,210\\n\\nSEGMENT INFORMATION BY OPERATING SEGMENT\\n\\n2,162\\n\\n4,499\\n\\n103\\n\\n194\\n\\n1,725\\n\\n2,272\\n\\n– 235\\n\\n– 96\\n\\n1,467\\n\\n249\\n\\n5,222\\n\\n7,118\\n\\nResult from equity accounted investments\\n\\n920\\n\\n136\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n920\\n\\n136\\n\\nCapital expenditure on non-current assets\\n\\n6,041\\n\\n7,607\\n\\n146\\n\\n149\\n\\n24,146\\n\\n27,544\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n– 6,291\\n\\n– 7,003\\n\\n24,042\\n\\n28,297\\n\\nDepreciation and amortisation on non-current assets\\n\\n5,978\\n\\n5,853\\n\\n119\\n\\n110\\n\\n12,054\\n\\n11,142\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n– 6,175\\n\\n– 6,356\\n\\n11,976\\n\\n10,749\\n\\nAutomotive\\nin € million\\n\\nSegment assets\\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method\\n\\nMotorcycles\\n\\nFinancial Services\\n\\nReconciliation\\nto Group figures\\n\\nOther Entities\\n\\nGroup\\n\\n31. 12. 2020\\n\\n31. 12. 2019\\n\\n31. 12. 2020\\n\\n31. 12. 2019\\n\\n31. 12. 2020\\n\\n31. 12. 2019\\n\\n31. 12. 2020\\n\\n31. 12. 2019\\n\\n31. 12. 2020\\n\\n31. 12. 2019\\n\\n31. 12. 2020\\n\\n31. 12. 2019\\n\\n15,779\\n\\n16,193\\n\\n681\\n\\n712\\n\\n15,555\\n\\n15,545\\n\\n98,226\\n\\n106,038\\n\\n86,417\\n\\n89,546\\n\\n216,658\\n\\n228,034\\n\\n3,585\\n\\n3,199\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n3,585\\n\\n3,199\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nGroup Financial Statements\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\\n\\nWrite-downs on inventories to their net realisable\\nvalue amounting to € 59 million (2019: € 126 million)\\nwere recognised by the Automotive segment in the financial year 2020.

Recommendations\\nmade by an independent external remuneration expert\\nand suggestions made by investors and analysts are also\\nconsidered in the consultative process.\\nThe Supervisory Board is required to submit the re\\xad\\nmuneration system to the Annual General Meeting for\\napproval in the event of significant changes, but at least\\nevery four years. The remuneration system valid for the\\n2020 financial year was approved by the Annual General\\nMeeting in 2018.\\n\\nPrinciples of remuneration\\nThe remuneration system for the Board of Manage\\xad\\nment at BMW AG is designed to encourage a manage\\xad\\nment approach focused on the sustainable and long\\xadterm\\ndevelopment of the BMW Group. One further principle\\napplied when designing remuneration systems at BMW is\\nthat of consistency at different levels. This means that re\\xad\\nmuneration systems for the Board of Management, senior\\nmanagement and employees of BMW AG are composed\\nof similar elements. The Supervisory Board performs an\\nannual review to ensure that all Board of Management re\\xad\\nmuneration components are appropriate, individually and\\nin total, and do not encourage the Board of Management\\nto take inappropriate risks for the BMW Group. At the\\nsame time, the remuneration model used for the Board\\nof Management needs to be attractive for highly qualified\\nexecutives in a competitive environment.\\nThe remuneration of members of the Board of Man\\xad\\nagement is determined by the full Supervisory Board\\non the basis of performance criteria and after taking\\ninto account any remuneration received from Group\\ncompanies. The principal performance criteria are the\\ntasks and exercise of mandate of the Board member,\\nthe economic situation as well as the performance and\\nfuture prospects of the BMW Group. The Supervisory\\nBoard sets ambitious and relevant parameters as the basis\\nfor variable remuneration. It also ensures that variable\\ncomponents based on multi\\xadyear criteria take account of\\nboth positive and negative developments and that the\\noverall incentive is on the long term. As a general rule,\\ntargets and comparative parameters may not be changed\\nretrospectively.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCorporate Governance\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nRemuneration Report\\n\\n292\\n\\nRemuneration system, remuneration components\\nBoard of Management remuneration comprises fixed\\nand variable cash elements as well as a share\\xadbased com\\xad\\nponent.

The level of the earnings\\xadrelated component\\ndepends on the degree to which the targets set by the Su\\xad\\npervisory Board for Group net profit and Group post\\xadtax\\nreturn on sales are achieved. The degree of achievement\\nis expressed in an earnings factor.

The three\\xadyear assessment period for this re\\xad\\nmuneration component, which was subject to specified\\nforfeiture provisions, expired on 31 December 2020. The\\nearnings factors determined for each year of the assess\\xad\\nment period (financial year 2018: 1.520': None, ' financial year\\n2019: 0.798, financial year 2020: 0.444), give rise to a mul\\xad\\nti\\xadyear earnings factor of 0.921. The Supervisory Board\\nset the multi\\xadyear performance factor at 1.0 for members\\nof the Board of Management in office in financial year\\n2018, so that the PCP factor for the PCP 2018 – 2020 is\\n0.921. For the purposes of determining the multi\\xadyear\\nperformance factor, the Supervisory Board took account\\nin particular of business development during the assess\\xad\\nment period, the outlook for business development going\\nforward, the Board member’s individual contribution to\\nprofitability and the status of compliance within the\\nBoard member’s area of responsibility. When consider\\xad\\ning actual and forecasted business development for the\\n\\nrelevant periods, the Supervisory Board paid particular\\nattention to the development of certain key performance\\nfigures such as the number of deliveries, the EBIT margin\\nand the return on capital employed. For the financial\\nyear 2020, the Supervisory Board took account of the\\nimpact of the coronavirus pandemic of these figures. It\\nwas not necessary to change the assessments relating to\\nindividual contributions to profitability or the status of\\ncompliance within Board members’ area of responsibility.\\nIn accordance with the requirements of HGB and\\nGerman Accounting Standard No. 17, PCP\\xadrelated re\\xad\\nmuneration is required to be included in the total remu\\xad\\nneration figure for the financial year in which the plan’s\\nconditions are fulfilled.

At its meeting\\nin December 2020, the Supervisory Board, acting on the\\nrecommendation of the Personnel Committee, resolved\\nto revise the existing system of Board of Management\\nremuneration for financial years from 2021 onwards.\\nIn its deliberations, the Supervisory Board also took\\ninto account the recommendations of an independent\\nremuneration expert as well as suggestions from investor\\nrepresentatives and analysts. In agreement with the mem\\xad\\nbers of the Board of Management in office at that time,\\nthe relevant service contracts were amended with effect\\nfrom 1 January 2021, in order to implement changes to\\nthe remuneration system for financial years from 2021\\nonwards for all Board members at the same time.\\n\\n317\\n\\nThe Supervisory Board will submit the new system\\nfor Board of Management remuneration to the 2021\\nAnnual General Meeting for approval. The new remu\\xad\\nneration system will be explained in detail in the notice\\ndocument inviting shareholders to the Annual General\\nMeeting.\\nKey features of the new remuneration system include\\nin particular:\\n\\n— The new remuneration system for members of the\\n\\nBoard of Management is designed to be simple,\\nclear and easy to understand. It complies with the\\nrequirements of the German Stock Corporation Act\\n(AktG) and the recommendations and suggestions of\\nthe GCCC for executive board remuneration.\\n\\n— Under the new remuneration system, variable,\\n\\nearnings\\xadrelated remuneration will be oriented even\\nmore closely towards the company’s sustainable de\\xad\\nvelopment. Non\\xadfinancial targets, particularly in the\\nareas of the environment (e. g. reduction of carbon\\nemissions), social issues and governance are taken\\ninto account appropriately.\\n\\n— The Performance Cash Plan will no longer apply in\\n\\nthe future, resulting in a simplification of the remu\\xad\\nneration system.\\n\\n— In future, most of the variable remuneration of the\\n\\nBoard of Management will be determined using\\na share\\xadbased approach, in compliance with the\\n\\nrecommendation of the GCCC in the version dated\\n16 December 2019. In order to simplify the remu\\xad\\nneration system, the matching component that was\\npreviously paid out in cash or shares at the end of\\nthe four\\xadyear holding period no longer applies. As in\\nthe past, the company awards a so\\xadcalled “personal\\ncash investment amount”, which is required to be\\nused – after tax and deductions – to acquire shares\\nof BMW common stock. Compared to the previous\\narrangements, the personal cash investment amount\\nwill have a significantly higher weighting within the\\ntarget structure, given that it replaces the PCP as a\\nlong\\xadterm incentive. Within the target structure, one\\nhalf of the personal cash investment amount will be\\nlinked to the attainment of an RoCE target for the\\nAutomotive segment and one half to the attainment\\nof strategic focus targets set by the Supervisory Board\\nin accordance with corporate planning.\\n\\n— The members of the Board of Management are re\\xad\\n\\nquired to hold the BMW common stock acquired with\\nthe personal cash investment amount on a long\\xadterm\\nbasis, i. e. at least for a period of four years.\\n\\n— In the new remuneration system, the payment of var\\xad\\niable remuneration components is subject to special\\nmalus and clawback clauses.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCorporate Governance\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nRemuneration Report\\n\\n318\\n\\nOutlook: Remuneration elements, parameters, target remuneration levels and caps for financial years from financial year 2021 onwards\\nComponent\\n\\nParameters / measurement base, applicable amounts\\n\\nBASE SALARY\\nMember of the Board of Management:\\n— € 0.90 million p. a.

These\\nmatters were addressed in the context of our audit of\\nthe consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in\\nforming our audit opinion thereon': None, ' we do not provide a\\nseparate audit opinion on these matters.\\nIn our view, the matters of most significance in our\\naudit were as follows:\\n1\\n\\nMeasurement of leased products\\n\\n2\\n\\nValuation of receivables from sales financing\\n\\n3\\n\\nValuation of provisions for statutory and\\nnon-statutory warranty obligations and product\\nguarantees\\n\\n4\\n\\nMeasurement of YOUR NOW equity investment\\n\\n5\\n\\nMeasurement of provision for risks relating to\\nan EU antitrust proceeding\\n\\n332\\n\\nOur presentation of these key audit matters has been\\nstructured in each case as follows:\\n1\\n\\nMatter and issue\\n\\n2\\n\\nAudit approach and findings\\n\\n3\\n\\nReference to further information\\nHereinafter we present the key audit matters:\\n\\n1\\n\\nMeasurement of leased products\\n\\n1\\n\\nThe BMW Group leases vehicles to end customers\\nunder operating leases (leased products). At the bal\\xad\\nance sheet date, the figure reported under the “leased\\nproducts” line item for operating leases was EUR\\n41,995 million (approximately 19.4 % of total assets).\\nLeased products are measured at cost, which is de\\xad\\npreciated on a straight\\xadline basis over the lease term\\nto the expected residual value (recoverable amount).\\nA key estimated value for subsequent measurement\\nof leased products is the expected residual value at\\nthe end of the lease term. The BMW Group uses in\\xad\\nternally available data on historical empirical values,\\ncurrent market data and market estimates as well\\nas forecasts by external market research institutes.\\nThe estimation of future residual values is subject to\\njudgment due to the large number of assumptions to\\nbe made by the executive directors and the amount\\nof data included in the determination.\\nAgainst this background and due to the resulting\\nsignificant uncertainties with regard to estimates in\\nthe context of measuring the residual values of the\\nleased products, this matter was of particular signif\\xad\\nicance in the context of our audit.\\n\\n2\\n\\nAs part of our audit we obtained an understanding of\\nthe development of operating leases, the underlying\\nresidual value risks as well as the business processes\\nfor the identification, management, monitoring and\\nmeasurement of residual value risks, among other\\nthings by inquiries and inspection of documents\\nrelated to the internal calculation methods. Fur\\xad\\nthermore, we evaluated the appropriateness and\\neffectiveness of the internal control system, par\\xad\\nticularly regarding the determination of expected\\nresidual values.

Impairment losses\\namounting to EUR 1,639 million were recognized\\non these receivables as at the balance sheet date.\\nIn order to determine the amount of the necessary\\nvaluation allowances to be recognized with respect\\nto receivables from sales financing, the BMW Group,\\namong others, evaluates the creditworthiness of the\\ndealers, importers and end customers, as well as\\nany loss ratios, and risk provisioning parameters are\\nderived based on historical default probabilities and\\nloss ratios.\\nThe determination of the valuation allowances by the\\nexecutive directors is subject to a significant degree\\nof judgment due to several value\\xadinfluencing factors\\nsuch as the estimation of creditworthiness, the de\\xad\\ntermination of probabilities of default and loss ratios\\nand was therefore of particular significance in the\\ncontext of our audit.\\n\\n333\\n\\n2\\n\\nAs part of our audit we obtained a comprehensive\\nunderstanding of the development of receivables\\nfrom sales financing, the associated default\\xadrelated\\nrisks as well as the business processes for the identi\\xad\\nfication, management, monitoring and measurement\\nof default risks , among other things by inquiries\\nand inspection of documents on the internal cal\\xad\\nculation methods. Furthermore, we evaluated the\\nappropriateness and effectiveness of the internal\\ncontrol system regarding the determination of the\\nimpairment loss to recognize. In this context, we also\\nevaluated the relevant IT systems and internal pro\\xad\\ncesses. The evaluation included an assessment by our\\nIT specialists of the appropriateness of the systems\\nconcerned and associated interfaces to ensure the\\ncompleteness of data as well as the audit of auto\\xad\\nmated controls for data processing. As part of our\\naudit we assessed in particular the appropriateness\\nof the risk classification procedures as well as the risk\\nprovisioning parameters used. For this purpose, we\\nanalyzed in particular the validations of parameters\\nthat are regularly conducted by the Company. To as\\xad\\nsess the default risk, we also used targeted sampling\\nof individual cases to examine whether the attributes\\nfor assignment to the respective risk categories were\\nsuitably available and the impairment losses had\\nbeen calculated using the parameters defined for\\nthese risk categories.\\nIn our view, the assumptions and parameters used in\\nthe measurement of receivables from sales financing\\nwere appropriate overall.\\n\\n3\\n\\nThe Company’s disclosures on the applied “Account\\xad\\ning policies, assumptions, judgments and estima\\xad\\ntions” are contained in the notes to the consolidated\\nfinancial statements under note 5 and on “receivables\\nfrom sales financing” are contained under note 25.\\n\\n3\\n\\nValuation of provisions for statutory and non-statutory warranty obligations and product guarantees\\n\\n1\\n\\nProvisions for statutory and non\\xadstatutory warranty\\nobligations as well as product guarantees are in\\xad\\ncluded in the consolidated financial statements of\\nBMW Group as a material amount in other provi\\xad\\nsions. The obligations amounted to EUR 6,131 mil\\xad\\nlion (approximately 2.8 % of total assets) as at De\\xad\\ncember 31, 2020. BMW Group is responsible for the\\nlegally required warranty and product guarantees in\\nthe respective sales market. In order to estimate the\\nliabilities arising from statutory and non\\xadstatutory\\nwarranty obligations and product guarantees for\\nvehicles sold, information on the type and volume\\nof damages arising and on remedial measures is\\nrecorded and analyzed at vehicle model level. The\\nexpected amount of obligations is extrapolated from\\ncosts of the past and recognized as a provision in\\nthe corresponding amount, if the criteria of IAS 37\\nhave been met. For specific or anticipated individual\\ncircumstances, for example recalls, additional provi\\xad\\nsions are recognized provided they have not already\\nbeen taken into account.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCorporate Governance\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nIndependent Auditor’s Report\\n\\nThe determination of provisions is associated with\\nunavoidable estimation uncertainties and is subject\\nto a high risk of change, depending on factors such\\nas notification of detected defects as well as claims\\nmade by vehicle owners. Against this background, this\\nmatter was of particular significance during our audit.\\n2\\n\\nIn order to assess the appropriateness of the val\\xad\\nuation method used for the determination of the\\nprovisions for statutory and non\\xadstatutory warranty\\nobligations as well as product guarantees including\\nthe assumptions and parameters, we primarily ob\\xad\\ntained an understanding of the process for deter\\xad\\nmining the assumptions and parameters through\\ndiscussions with the responsible employees of the\\nBMW Group. We also evaluated the appropriateness\\nas well as effectiveness of controls for determining\\nthe assumptions and parameters. With the involve\\xad\\nment of our IT specialists, we checked the IT systems\\nused regarding their compliance. We compared the\\nexpenses for claims and technical actions with ac\\xad\\ntual costs incurred in order to draw conclusions on\\nthe forecast accuracy. Based on a targeted sample\\nof vehicle models, the mathematically correctness\\nof the valuation model used across the Group was\\nexamined. We examined and evaluated the assump\\xad\\ntions used by the BMW Group concerning the extent\\nto which the past values were representative of the\\nexpected susceptibility of damage, the expected value\\nof damage per vehicle (comprising parts and labor\\ninput) as well as the expected assertion of claims\\nfrom statutory and non\\xadstatutory warranties.\\nIn our view, the method for the valuation of provi\\xad\\nsions for statutory and non\\xadstatutory warranty obli\\xad\\ngations as well as product guarantees is overall ap\\xad\\npropriate. Taking into consideration the information\\n\\n334\\n\\navailable, we believe that, overall, the measurement\\nparameters and assumptions used by the executive\\ndirectors are appropriate.\\n3\\n\\nThe Company’s disclosures on the applied “Account\\xad\\ning policies, assumptions, judgments and estima\\xad\\ntions” are contained in the notes to the consolidated\\nfinancial statements under note 5 and on “Other\\nprovisions” are contained under note 33.\\n\\n4\\n\\nMeasurement of YOUR NOW equity investment\\n\\n1\\n\\nIn the BMW Group’s consolidated financial state\\xad\\nments as at December 31, 2020, the YOUR NOW\\nequity investment is reported under the balance\\nsheet item “Investments accounted for using the\\nequity method” with a carrying amount of EUR\\n591 million (approximately 0.3 % of total assets). The\\nBMW Group and a competitor have bundled mobility\\nservices within YOUR NOW. In the financial year\\n2020 YOUR NOW generated negative operating\\nearnings amounting to EUR 349 million, which were\\nrecognized in the consolidated financial statements.\\nFurthermore, there was a triggering event at the level\\nof the BMW Group. The Company has identified as a\\ntriggering event in particular a significant deviation\\nfrom target figures and the impacts of the coronavi\\xad\\nrus crisis regarding the YOUR NOW equity invest\\xad\\nment. As a result of the impairment test performed,\\nno further write\\xaddowns were necessary as at balance\\nsheet date.\\nThe measurement of the YOUR NOW equity invest\\xad\\nment, including the performance of the impairment\\ntest, depends to a significant degree on the estimates\\nmade by the executive directors and their exercise of\\njudgment, which are subject to significant estimation\\n\\nuncertainties. Against this background, this matter\\nwas of particular significance during our audit.\\n2\\n\\nAs part of our audit, we examined and evaluated the\\nmethodological procedure adopted for the purposes\\nof measuring the YOUR NOW equity investment as\\nwell as for performing the impairment test, among\\nother things. We also assessed the appropriateness\\nof the valuation parameters and assumptions on\\nwhich the measurement was based. We examined\\nthe impairment test conducted by the BMW Group\\nbased on the occurrence of a triggering event. After\\ncomparing the future cash inflows used in the calcu\\xad\\nlation against the underlying budget, we assessed the\\nappropriateness of the calculation, in particular by\\nreconciling it with general and sectorspecific market\\nexpectations. Moreover, we evaluated the estimates\\nmade by the executive directors with respect to the\\nimpacts of the coronavirus crisis on the YOUR NOW\\nequity investment and examined its consideration\\nin the calculation of future cash inflows. We also as\\xad\\nsessed the parameters used to determine the discount\\nrate applied and examined the measurement model.\\nThe valuation parameters and assumptions used by\\nthe executive directors are overall in line with our ex\\xad\\npectations and are also within the ranges considered\\nby us to be acceptable.\\n\\n3\\n\\nThe Company’s disclosures on the applied “Account\\xad\\ning policies, assumptions, judgments and estimations”\\nare contained in the notes to the consolidated finan\\xad\\ncial statements under note 5 and on the YOUR NOW\\nequity investment are contained under note 24.\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nCorporate Governance\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nIndependent Auditor’s Report\\n\\n5\\n\\nMeasurement of provision for risks relating to an\\nEU antitrust proceeding\\n\\n1\\n\\nIn April 2019, the BMW Group was notified by the\\nEuropean Commission of complaints in a pending\\nantitrust proceeding. The European Commission\\naccuses various manufacturers of colluding to re\\xad\\nstrict competition in the field of innovation. In this\\nconnection, as in the previous year, a EUR 1.4 billion\\nprovision for litigation and risk provisioning was rec\\xad\\nognized at the balance sheet date in the consolidated\\nfinancial statements under the balance sheet item\\n“Other provisions”. The risk assessment to be made\\non developments in the EU antitrust proceeding and\\nthe estimation of whether or not a provision must\\nbe recognized to cover the risks, and if so, in what\\namount the current obligation must be measured, is\\nsubject to a high degree of uncertainties and charac\\xad\\nterized by the estimates and assumptions made by\\nthe executive directors.\\nIn our view, this matter was of particular significance\\nfor our audit due to the significant uncertainties con\\xad\\ncerning the outcome of the EU antitrust proceeding\\nand the potential effects on BMW AG’s assets, liabil\\xad\\nities, financial position and financial performance.\\n\\n2\\n\\nWith the knowledge that estimated values result in an\\nincreased risk of accounting misstatements and that\\nthe executive directors’ recognition and measure\\xad\\nment decisions have a direct effect on consolidated\\nresult, we evaluated the retention of the carrying\\namounts, with the involvement of an internal PwC\\nantitrust law expert. Furthermore, we also held reg\\xad\\nular meetings with the Company’s legal department\\nin order to receive updates on current developments\\nand the reasons for the corresponding estimates. The\\n\\n335\\n\\ndevelopment of the aforementioned risks arising\\nfrom the EU antitrust proceeding, including the\\nexecutive directors’ estimates concerning the poten\\xad\\ntial proceeding outcomes, was provided to us by the\\nCompany in writing.

Corresponding to the CO2e emissions, the life cycle assessments show the energy consumption (lower calorific value): around 75,640,609 MWh\\nin the upstream chain and around 502,243 MWh at disposal companies.\\n12 The fleet emissions are extrapolated from the average fleet emissions of the main sales markets of the BMW Group.

Responsibility of the Board of Management for climate-related risks and opportunities\\nThe highest level of direct responsibility for climate change issues is the Board of Management, which determines the Group’s strategic course with regard to sustainability issues, including addressing climate change. Every proposal considered by the Board of Management must be assessed from a sustainability perspective.\\nThe new substance targets for 2030 developed and adopted in 2020 that focus on decarbonisation have been incorporated into the BMW Group’s target controlling\\nsystem and will be taken into account in the compensation of the Board of Management and top management going forward.\\nB. The role of management in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities\\nAll Board of Management members bear responsibility for climate change-related issues and ensure that the Group’s strategy with regard to sustainability and climate\\nchange is implemented as a systematic driver in all Board areas of responsibility. One focus of the Group’s strategy in the 2020 reporting year was the topic of addressing\\nclimate-related risks and opportunities. The impacts of this topic were assessed, internal structures for decision-making and controlling were established with the participation of top management, and project organisations were set up in the relevant Board areas of responsibility.\\n\\nSTRATEGY\\n\\nSustainability is the basic pattern that shapes the BMW Group’s strategy. From beginning to end, activities and plans should comprehensively be examined with regard to\\ntheir economic, ecological and social impacts and the corresponding decisions taken based on an integrated approach. The BMW Group is firmly convinced that the fight\\nagainst climate change and the responsible use of resources will determine the future of our society – and thus also that of the BMW Group. Particularly as a premium\\nmanufacturer, the BMW Group aspires to lead the way in promoting sustainability. In addition to the Group’s activities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation),\\naddressing the consequences of climate change (adaptation) is also being dealt with and assessed within the framework of the “Adaptation to Climate Change” strategy\\nproject.\\nA. Climate-related risks and opportunities\\nAs a globally leading provider of premium automobiles, motorcycles, mobility services and financial services, the BMW Group is exposed to an array of uncertainties and\\nchanges. In order to ensure growth, profitability, efficiency and continued sustainability going forward, the BMW Group needs to take well calculated risks and make full use\\nof any opportunities that present themselves.\\nIn the context of its “Adaptation to Climate Change” strategy project, the BMW Group is preparing for a broad range of possible consequences and plans to systematically\\nintegrate reporting on the opportunities and risks associated with climate change in its Group Report.\\n\\nReference to chapters in the BMW Group Report\\n2020 and the CDP questionnaire for 2020\\n\\nBMW Group Report 2020:\\nStrategy, Goals and Management\\nSystem\\nCorporate Governance\\nCDP questionnaire 2020:\\nA: C1.1b\\nB: C1.2, C1.2a\\n\\nCDP questionnaire 2020:\\nStrategy, Goals and Management\\nSystem\\nRisks and Opportunities\\nProducts and Services\\nProduction, Purchasing and\\nSupplier Network\\nCDP questionnaire 2020:\\nA: C2.1, C2.3, C2.3a, C2.4, C2.4a\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nOther Information\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nTCFD-Index\\n\\nTCFD Key elements\\n\\nKey elements of summarised disclosures / Key messages\\n\\nSTRATEGY\\n\\nSignificant opportunities\\n— The BMW Group intends to press ahead with the systematic electrification of all its brands and model series. By 2023, it plans to have 25 electrified vehicles on the road.\\nAchieving this aim will provide the Group with an attractive portfolio to respond to the growing customer demand for battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.\\n— Smart, scalable vehicle architectures that can be equipped with all available types of drivetrain systems are intended to give the Group the flexibility to successfully\\nimplement the shift towards climate neutrality that is both called for politically and aspired to socially.\\n— The BMW Group’s production system is capable of manufacturing both conventional internal combustion and electrically powered vehicles on a single line, enabling it\\nto respond flexibly to changing customer requirements for various drivetrain systems.\\n— (The BMW Group is convinced that the ability to produce electric drivetrains, batteries and prototypes for battery cells in-house creates a decisive competitive advantage that enables it...)\\nThe BMW Group is convinced that the ability to produce electric drivetrains, batteries and prototypes for battery cells in-house gives it a decisive competitive edge that\\nenables it to safeguard its know-how in new technologies, gain crucial system expertise and leverage cost advantages.\\n— Contracts have been concluded with various battery cell suppliers in order to safeguard the Group’s electrification strategy. Volume flexibility has been written into the\\ncontracts to ensure additional latitude in the supply of battery cells.\\n— The BMW Group has already contractually agreed with its cell manufacturers that only green electricity will be used to produce the fifth generation of battery cells.\\nFrom the BMW Group’s point of view, establishing the carbon footprint as an award criterion in the supply chain is a key competitive advantage in efficiently reducing\\ncarbon emissions in upstream processes.\\n— The BMW Group is boosting efficiency and cutting costs by switching to lower-carbon processes and technologies in its own production facilities.\\n— By generating its own electricity from renewable sources, the BMW Group is reducing not only its carbon footprint, but also its dependence on external sources.\\n— The BMW Group is adapting to the expected consequences of climate change by conducting an assessment and deriving measures required to mitigate the physical\\nrisks for BMW-relevant assets (e. g. properties, suppliers, logistics).\\nSignificant risks\\n— As climate change progresses, natural disasters are likely to occur on an increasing scale and impact the BMW Group in a variety of ways, with a negative influence on\\neconomic growth in the affected regions, among other factors. Any ensuing drop in consumer purchasing power due to a loss of income and the threat of unemployment would, in turn, have a negative earnings impact for the BMW Group.\\n— The short-term introduction of more stringent legislation and regulations in the BMW Group’s main markets (EU, USA, China), particularly regarding carbon emissions\\nregulations, could have an effect on the Group’s range of products and services.\\n— The scale of acute and chronic physical risks (e. g. floods, storms, droughts) to BMW-relevant assets (e. g. properties, suppliers, logistics) could rise.\\n— There could a greater risk of interruptions in the supply chain or the inability of individual suppliers to deliver, particularly due to breaches of sustainability or quality\\nstandards and the danger of natural disasters.\\n— The risk of bottlenecks in the availability of raw materials, particularly those required to manufacture battery cells could increase. Moreover, if commodity price risks\\nmaterialise, they could have an impact on earnings.\\n— The rising price required to be paid for CO2 emissions in energy-intensive supply chains could result in higher purchasing prices.\\n— More stringent regulatory requirements for issuers could make the BMW Group less attractive as a sustainable investment.\\n\\n360\\n\\nReference to chapters in the BMW Group Report\\n2020 and the CDP questionnaire for 2020\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nOther Information\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nTCFD-Index\\n\\n361\\n\\nTCFD Key elements\\n\\nKey elements of summarised disclosures / Key messages\\n\\nReference to chapters in the BMW Group Report\\n2020 and the CDP questionnaire for 2020\\n\\nSTRATEGY\\n\\nB. The impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the Group's business activities and its strategic and financial corporate planning\\nThe necessity to contain climate change has a major impact on both short- and long-term decision-making at the BMW Group. In the year under report, the BMW Group\\nassessed its carbon emissions over the entire life cycle of its vehicles, using the internationally recognised method devised by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI).\\nDecarbonisation targets for the supply chain, production and use phase of its vehicles were developed for the period up to 2030, approved by the Board of Management\\nand registered with the SBTI. From the BMW Group’s perspective, these science-based decarbonisation targets are intended to provide a clearly defined pathway to sustainable growth.\\n\\nCDP questionnaire 2020:\\nB: C2.3, C2.3a, C2.4a, C3.1, C3.1b,\\nC3.1d as well as examples of strategic\\ndecisions\\nC: C3.1a, C3.1d well as assessment of\\nstrategy resilience\\n\\nC. Resilience of the BMW Group's strategy\\nThe BMW Group conducts stress tests using qualitative and quantitative sensitivity analyses. Product planning, sales volumes and R&D investments all take the goals of\\nthe Paris Climate Agreement into account.\\nRISK\\nMANAGEMENTT\\n\\nA. Group processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks\\nRisk management is organised as a decentralised, Group-wide network and controlled via a centralised risk management function. Every BMW Group divisional area of\\nresponsibility is represented by Network Representatives. Any significant risks reported from within the network, including sustainability- and climate-related risks, are\\npresented for review to the Risk Management Steering Committee, which is chaired by Group Controlling. After review, any risks regarded as significant are reported to the\\nBoard of Management and the Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee. In addition, topics that represent opportunities or risks for the BMW Group’s business in the long\\nterm are identified by means of an environmental radar that continuously monitors external changes.\\nApart from reducing greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation), the topic of adaptation (adjustment to the consequences of climate change) was also addressed in line with\\nGroup strategy. As part of the strategy project set up for this purpose, key links in the BMW Group’s value chain were singled out (e. g. properties, suppliers, logistics,\\nproducts) for which the consequences of climate change are likely to be particularly relevant and for which adaptation measures will need to be taken in order to mitigate\\nmedium-term climatic changes.\\nVarious annual time slices as well as climate scenarios are used to determine the risks. Based on the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), three scenarios\\nwere defined in order to present and assess climate change-related risks. A low-emission scenario takes a < 2°C pathway into account. Accordingly, all countries worldwide agree to combat climate change and implement rigorous climate protection policies. On the one hand, this scenario means greater transition-related risks for the\\nBMW Group, for example due to stricter carbon emissions regulations in its main markets, but on the other hand it limits physical risks. The second climate scenario chosen by the BMW Group outlines a “medium” emissions scenario in which moderate emissions levels are assumed. Limited climate protection will lead to a medium level of\\ntransitional and physical risk. Another scenario portrays how the world will look if little or nothing is undertaken to protect the climate. This scenario would mean the highest level of emissions and therefore the highest level of physical risk.\\nB. Group processes for managing climate-related risks\\nThe efficient management of opportunities and risks is key to responding appropriately to changes that occur in political, economic, technical or legal conditions. The\\nBMW Group has put a comprehensive risk management system in place to manage these risks in a structured manner as they arise. The aim of the risk management system is to identify, assess and actively manage any risks that could threaten the attainment of the Group’s corporate targets. Within that process, any individual and cumulative risks that pose a threat to the BMW Group’s success are monitored and managed. As part of its “Adaptation to Climate Change” project, the BMW Group is discussing\\nthe integration of sustainability and, above all, climate-related risks in Group-wide risk management processes.\\nRisks are classified both according to their potential impact on earnings (worst-case scenario) and according to the risk amount (average earnings impact, taking into\\naccount the probability of occurrence).\\nAs part of the existing natural hazard assessment process for properties and suppliers, current climate change-related hazards are also taken into account and assessed\\naccordingly. The consideration of future medium-term physical risks is being investigated within the context of a current strategy project.\\nC. Integrating processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks within the Group's general risk management system\\nAlongside comprehensive risk management, sustainability constitutes a core strategic principle of the BMW Group. Risks resulting from sustainability aspects that could\\nhave an impact on the BMW Group are generally identified via the Group-wide risk management network.\\nWhen analysing sustainability-related opportunities and risks, the physical risks associated with climate change (e. g. disruption of supply chains due to natural hazards)\\nand transition-related risks (such as the ability to meet emissions requirements) are also assessed.\\n\\nBMW Group Report 2020:\\nRisks and Opportunities\\nCDP questionnaire 2020:\\nA: C2.2, C2.2a\\nB: C2.2a\\nC: C2.2\\n\\n\\x0cBMW Group\\n\\nOther Information\\n\\nReport 2020\\n\\nTCFD-Index\\n\\nTCFD Key elements\\n\\nKey elements of summarised disclosures / Key messages\\n\\n362\\n\\nReference to chapters in the BMW Group Report\\n2020 and the CDP questionnaire for 2020\\n\\nKEY SUSTAINABILITY A.
